# Codex review notes — Aero / Grok follow-ups

This file is for the Codex reviewer. It is written in plain language so the
intent of the pull request is not reconstructed from the diff.

## What this PR is

Follow-up to already-merged upstream PR #60 (Grok sign-in, agent control, Aero
ribbon). This branch is the same 55-file delta that `halthinks/main` already
carries over `10-X-eng/main`, rebased onto current upstream `main` with
checkpoint and merge commits squashed.

It adds hardening, Connect Grok Bot, an in-process geometry-worker fallback,
the Codex review fixes already landed on the fork, and fork PR #12: an equal
Aero designer for in-app Grok and Grok Bot.

## What this PR is not

This PR does **not** include a full Aero user manual.

This PR does **not** include the full updated ribbon-use explanations or
tool-use explanations. Those docs are a later PR.

`docs/stevecad-aero.md` only has a small delta (Analyze default, tail gating).
Treat that as incomplete on purpose. Do not ask this PR to grow into the
manual.

This PR does **not** restore HTTP MCP (`:8765/mcp`) and does **not** restore
the legacy Workbenches preferences page. Both absences are intentional.

This PR does **not** touch TextPCB.

## User-visible behavior

- Analyze repair is opt-in: `run_analyze(..., repair=False)`. Report and
  JSBSim stay observational unless the user requests repair.
- If the user does request repair, pitch-unstable geometry can be corrected
  and the change list is shown.
- Solver horizontal tail is used only when CAD has a named `h_tail` or
  explicit tail sizes. No invented tail defaults.
- BoundBox repair never assigns getter-only `XLength` / `YLength` /
  `ZLength`.
- Aero Analyze JSON is stored on the `AeroAssistantJson` TextDocument
  (`obj.Text`). The document string, if any, is the distinct
  `AeroAssistantJsonText`. Never setattr over the object name.
- Aero steering is queued only while an in-app Grok run is active. Toolbar
  Analyze still persists and appends the report.
- In-app Grok gets a multi-view visual protocol: isometric, front, and top;
  pixels are not dimensions; stop retrying a view when the screenshot is
  unchanged.
- Preferences: Connect Grok Bot on loopback `127.0.0.1:8766`, writes an
  `AGENTS.md` brief, and launches
  `C:\Program Files\Grok Bot\Grok Bot.exe` (not Grok Build `grok.exe`).
  Copy connection includes `brief_path`. Apply persists `GrokBotCommand`.
- If `SteveCADGeometryWorker.exe` is missing, `read_geometry` can fall back
  in-process.
- Compact reference images still downscale when the long edge exceeds
  `max_edge`.
- Fetch-models probes Ollama `/api/version` once.
- Analyze feeds the in-app clanker: it starts a Build turn, or steers if one
  is already running, with the flight card and the `not_airworthy` ceiling.
- Grok Bot is first-class on the same Aero wrapper:
  - `GET /v1/aero` returns stamped context plus the flight card.
  - `POST /v1/aero` runs analyze / section / vlm / export / report /
    propose / apply / reject / flight_card.
  - `/v1/run` exec cannot apply Aero CAD via `repair=True` or
    `apply_repairs(`; those go through `POST /v1/aero`.
  - Status includes an `aero` snapshot.
- Native families are split (`aero.solve` / `aero.export` / `aero.inspect`)
  so Grok tools can actually call Analyze.
- Tail volume waits unless `has_h_tail` is true. No invented tail volume
  for a tailless document.
- `battery_wh` persists on `AeroConfig`.

## Native Aero

Airplane is on the Native tool list. A flight-card wrapper exists. Native
families are `aero.solve`, `aero.export`, and `aero.inspect`. Claim ceiling
is always `not_airworthy`.

Do not claim a finished Aero manual or a finished ribbon / tool tutorial.
Those are later work.

Fork PR #12 made in-app Grok and Grok Bot equal Aero designers. Do not
treat `/v1/aero` as optional or tell Grok Bot to `exec` Analyze.

## Intentional non-goals (do not "fix" these)

- HTTP MCP / `:8765/mcp` stays stdio-only by design
  (`MCP_TRANSPORT = "stdio"`).
- The legacy Workbenches preferences page stays unregistered
  (`test_stevecad_does_not_expose_the_legacy_workbench_preferences_page`).

```

`src/Mod/SteveCADAero/tests` already collects `test_honesty.py`. It is listed
again so reviewers do not skip the honesty payload.

## Additive / compatibility

No public API removals. New optional `AeroAssistantJsonText`. New Grok Bot
routes `GET/POST /v1/aero` and Native families `aero.export` / `aero.inspect`
are additive. Agent control is still `127.0.0.1` only. OpenAI / Anthropic
paths are unchanged. `/v1/run` still runs non-Aero Python; it refuses Aero
CAD mutation (`repair=True` / `apply_repairs(`).

Repair default is now `False`. That **is** a default change versus current
upstream `repair=True`. It is the Codex-requested opt-in: Analyze still
works; it just does not mutate CAD unless asked.

## Geometry note for reviewers

AeroSandbox +X is aft. CAD +X is nose. Upper wing aft of lower is a
biplane, not a canard.
