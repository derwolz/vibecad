Checklist status: 772 complete / 0 pending / 772 total (100% by row count)

## Purpose

Reintroduce Native assistant mode as a clean, ribbon-scoped authoring system.
The human chooses and changes the active SteveCAD ribbon. The assistant receives
only the tools belonging to that human-selected surface and cannot activate a
different workbench or ribbon for itself. The assistant may finish the exact
human-opened Sketch edit task only through the explicit Leave Sketch control;
that state change ends the current assistant turn.

Native mode must be substantially easier for an AI to use than the retired
direct-tool surface. SteveCAD owns document identity, revisions, transactions,
the current working set, operation receipts, and recovery. The assistant owns
modeling intent and explicit operation parameters; it is never expected to
reconstruct the document graph from a long transcript of tool calls.

## Owner-approved breaking-change scope

The owner explicitly approved the following direction in chat on 2026-08-06:

- remove the obsolete workbench-pack and direct native-tool architecture;
- remove compatibility aliases and compatibility-only response fields;
- change native tool names, schemas, and result contracts where needed;
- remove provider-accessible workbench switching;
- do not preserve saved native conversations or third-party callers of the
  retired native tool contracts;
- keep VibeScript as a separate, supported authoring system rather than mixing
  Native mutations into VibeScript regeneration.

This approval applies to the obsolete Native assistant surface. It does not
authorize unrelated public API removal, removal of VibeScript tools, removal of
human ribbon commands, or general FreeCAD cleanup.

The owner approved this additional Sketch boundary refinement on 2026-08-09:

- `document.open` remains human-authorized and is never provider-callable;
- `document.save` is not exposed while a Sketch edit task is active;
- Native exposes one exact-target Leave Sketch operation, while Cancel Sketch
  remains human-controlled;
- Leave Sketch may finish only the current human-opened Sketch task and must not
  activate another workbench or ribbon; and
- leaving Sketch invalidates the frozen turn, so the assistant must wait for a
  new human turn before using the newly resolved surface.

Affected callers are old Native assistant conversations, external clients that
called the old direct CAD tool names, tests of old workbench packs, and code
that consumes their old result shapes. There will be no compatibility shim or
dual registration. The migration is to start a new Native conversation against
the new ribbon surface. Rollback is by reverting the ordered implementation
commits before release, not by retaining two runtime architectures.

## Tracking model

This document is the granular execution plan and definition of done. During
implementation it should be attached to one durable Codex goal whose objective
is the final product outcome. The goal provides persistence; this ledger
provides the exact work breakdown. Neither replaces the other.

No checkbox may be closed from inference. Each capability row is complete only
when all of the following exist:

1. a final provider-facing schema or an explicit human-only classification;
2. an exact-target implementation using the correct domain API;
3. the concise success and failure result contract;
4. a correct domain-state update and transaction receipt;
5. focused tests for success, invalid input, undo, redo, and save/reopen when
   the operation mutates the document;
6. live ribbon-surface coverage proving the action did not disappear or leak
   onto another surface.

A broad end-to-end test cannot close multiple unfinished capability rows.

### Implementation evidence

The following evidence is part of the ledger and must stay current as the
implementation changes:

- The C++ ribbon controller publishes `SteveCADActiveSurfaceId`, a monotonic
  `SteveCADActiveSurfaceRevision`, and `SteveCADActiveSurfaceManifest` from the
  same deduplicated command entries used to build the visible page.
- A clean-profile GUI gate currently observes Model 75, Assemble 53, Mesh 60,
  Analyze 104, Manufacture 59, Drawing 107, Parameters 24, Sketch setup 15,
  and Sketch edit 105 actions, with 533 unique command IDs. These are the
  current default-preference build counts. With advanced and experimental CAM
  plus separated Drawing dimensions enabled, the same gate observes
  Manufacture 65 and Drawing 112 on the current build. The classified union is
  Manufacture 66 when optional CAMotics is available, Drawing 113 across both
  dimension layouts, and 546 unique ribbon command IDs overall.
- The Parameters ribbon is complete through five sharp capability families:
  sheet lifecycle, bounded exact reads, atomic cell/formula edits, explicit
  formatting, and human-authorized CSV output. All 16 shipped Spreadsheet
  actions map to exact variants, while provider-only reads and batch writes
  are shared only on the Parameters surface. The common SpreadsheetGui
  publication path gives human and Native sheet creation the same History
  semantics. UTF-8 CSV parsing and output generation run off the document/UI
  thread, use bounded detached data, never expose host paths, and commit only
  after exact document revalidation. The compiled lifecycle gate proves human
  parity, exact hashes, values, canonical formulas, aliases, model-expression
  propagation, merge/split, cell properties, all six alignments, all three
  styles, stale refusal, selection preservation, responsive import/export,
  History, undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. SpreadsheetGui and SteveCADScripts
  build cleanly, and the gate reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_PARAMETERS_GUI_OK`.
- `SteveCADNativeSurfaceVariants.py` now constrains conditional live surfaces to
  graphs the shipped workbenches can actually produce. Analyze covers both
  Netgen build states and the three valid VTK states as six environments with
  exact 82, 99, or 104-action group/composite graphs; VTK Python without VTK
  is rejected. Manufacture covers all eight CAM preference states, both Robot
  build states, and the valid OCL/CAMotics runtime combinations as 40 exact
  environments and 32 distinct visible graphs. Classification rejects an
  optional action under the wrong preference, a command moved to the wrong
  group, and flattened order disguised with the wrong composite parentage.
  Separate compiled GUI processes prove all eight CAM preference states on the
  current OCL-enabled/CAMotics-absent build: both simulator orders preserve
  Manufacture counts 59, 61, 62, and 65. The harness restores the exact prior
  preference values and key presence in `finally`; the default and maximum
  Drawing/CAM gates remain green.
- The complete 105-action Sketch edit ribbon resolves to 27 total provider
  tools including shared state, view, inspect, and undo tools. Drawing is
  exposed as focused line, arc, three-point arc, circle, ellipse, standard
  profile, spline, and text tools; the three-point arc schema has one operation
  and explicitly requires `first_endpoint_mm`, `rim_point_mm`, and
  `second_endpoint_mm`. The full schema set is 47,616 bytes, the Sketch-specific
  contracts contain no nested `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf` composition after their
  provider root, and the retired `sketch.geometry`, `sketch.constraint`,
  `sketch.cut`, and broad `sketch.draw` families are absent. A compiled real-GUI
  gate reads the initial Sketch revision, rejects malformed drawing arguments
  with a structured field diagnostic, creates and constrains geometry, rejects
  a stale revision without mutation, executes an atomic batch, captures a clean
  head-on Sketch image through the private multimodal attachment path, deletes
  geometry, and leaves Sketch with the required turn invalidation.
- The clean-profile GUI gate now computes named stale-manifest and unclassified
  live-action deltas before enforcing exact default order. Its maximum variant
  also proves the supported Drawing and Manufacture inventory union, while the
  pure conditional matrix proves every allowed Analyze/Manufacture action
  belongs to at least one valid environment. Removing a shipped action or
  retaining an optional action in no valid graph therefore fails the gate.
- The completed cross-ribbon gate now resolves the production registry and
  constructs the actual frozen-turn Codex dynamic-tool surface for every
  permanent and contextual ribbon state. The default graph reports 19 Model,
  17 Assemble, 18 Mesh, 30 Analyze, 23 Manufacture, 40 Drawing, 10 Parameters,
  8 Sketch setup, and 27 Sketch edit tools across 533 unique human commands.
  The maximum preference graph reports 24 Manufacture and 40 Drawing tools
  across 544 unique commands. Both graphs remain under the 128-KiB provider
  wire ceiling. Drawing and Parameters use the same compact provider form as
  Model, while dispatch revalidates every call against the selected operation's
  original closed schema. Nested CAM kind grammars likewise compact only on
  the provider wire; the untouched exact variant remains the execution
  authority. Reviewed SHA-256 snapshots lock the complete provider schema and
  action/context route graph for all nine states. The gate also proves common
  tools are byte-identical on every eligible state and cannot leak onto an
  ineligible one. Default and maximum live runs report
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_RIBBON_SURFACE_GUI_OK`.
- A separate saved-document acceptance gate now drives the visible UI through
  Model, Assemble, Mesh, Analyze, Manufacture, Drawing, Parameters, Sketch
  setup, and Sketch edit while retaining one Codex conversation. Every turn
  traverses the production `CodexProvider`, the frozen dynamic-tool adapter,
  the parent tool runner, and document-thread dispatch; its nested app-server
  callback invokes the real `state.read` tool and observes the matching live
  domain. It also proves that Save remains available in all eligible states
  and absent during Sketch edit. The clean-profile run reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_CODEX_CROSS_RIBBON_GUI_OK`. This replaces inference about
  inter-turn tool swapping with executable production-path evidence. The same
  harness has an explicit live-provider mode. Against the configured ChatGPT
  Codex provider, one temporary saved document and one conversation traversed
  all nine states; the external model invoked exactly one `state.read` per
  state, selected no mutation tools, and received the matching live domain.
  That run reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_CODEX_LIVE_CROSS_RIBBON_GUI_OK`.
- The final completion audit rebuilt the complete release tree successfully,
  reran both default and maximum live manifest/provider graphs, and passed all
  152 retired-architecture, modeling-surface, and Native authority guardrails.
  The VibeScript production files touched by the wider branch were exercised
  in their required runtimes: CAM and Robot passed their real-GUI lifecycle
  gates, while TechDraw passed its native worker/publication lifecycle gate.
  The acceptance documents and profiles were temporary; no user document was
  opened or changed.
- Sketch setup is a complete production surface rather than an empty fallback.
  It can create and validate reusable sketches and can map, reorient, merge, or
  mirror exact reusable Sketch definitions without entering edit mode. The
  compiled lifecycle gate preserves construction geometry, constraints,
  virtual constraints, expressions, History identity, undo/redo, and
  save/reopen state and reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_STRUCTURE_GUI_OK`.
- Compiled responsiveness gates prove point-cloud import/export and mutation
  stay backgrounded, expensive Drawing redraw keeps the GUI responsive, and
  SVG, DXF, and PDF Drawing output remains backgrounded, atomic, path-private,
  revision-stable, and undo-stable. They report
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_POINTS_GUI_OK`,
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_REDRAW_GUI_OK`, and
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_OUTPUT_GUI_OK`.
- `SteveCADRibbonSurface.py` strictly validates the live schema, action order,
  dropdown parentage, duplicate IDs, controller agreement, and revision. It
  exposes no activation or switching API.
- VibeScript surface resolution no longer imports or calls
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools`. All 17 registered VibeScript surface summaries had
  SHA-256 `05666abeb08e2f9ce89e6c254a6dd25cf76d8d47112395d753e95a8126397bf9`
  both before and after decoupling; 145 modeling-surface tests and 72
  provider/engine guardrail tests passed.
- The retired workbench-pack module and CMake entry are deleted. The provider
  registry now contains only the exact core/catalog/view tools, focused reads,
  saved assembly playback controls, and VibeScript tools that the current
  VibeScript surfaces advertise. A guardrail compares that set for exact
  equality, so an old direct Native name cannot remain quietly callable.
- No production module, runtime list, or old pack contract test imports
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools`; negative guardrails are the only remaining textual
  references. The obsolete
  command-prefix, arbitrary command-list, object-template, tool-pack, and
  pack-filtered workbench-object context paths have been removed from
  `SteveCADCore.py`. Old direct implementation files remain unregistered only
  as migration inputs; each must either supply a proven domain algorithm to a
  new capability module or be deleted under steps 2.12–2.13.
- `SteveCADNativeActionManifest.py` explicitly classifies the proven default
  action graph, exact Analyze/Manufacture environment variants, and conditional
  Drawing IDs. It preserves live order, rejects unknown IDs, group drift, and
  composite-role drift, and contains no dispatch or activation API. Default,
  maximum, and all eight CAM-preference clean-profile GUI gates pass.
- `SteveCADNativeContextManifest.py` separately inventories 27 current context
  actions: eleven Assembly, four CAM-only additions, ten Drawing, and two
  Inspection actions. Assembly context actions now have stable object names;
  source-drift tests prove the C++ and CAM context inventories exactly. The
  current SteveCAD fastener workflow adds no hidden context-only action: Model
  exposes four fastener commands and Assemble exposes Insert and Edit.
- `SteveCADNativeCapabilityRegistry.py` separates provider definitions from
  callable implementations, requires exact `domain.operation` names and
  discriminated variants, rejects open JSON objects and raw command dispatch,
  and enforces default plus explicit high-complexity surface tool/schema
  budgets below the provider transport ceiling.
  `SteveCADNativeSchemaRules.py` recursively rejects unbounded text and arrays,
  open nested objects, malformed required fields, and schema references. The
  production registry now contains the five finished common families, the
  finished Model structure/Sketch-readiness families, two compact typed
  `model.feature` variants covering all nine current Design primitives and all
  five reusable-profile Design operations, and the focused `model.hole`
  capability plus its read-only thread catalog. The focused `model.dressup`
  capability currently supplies Fillet, Chamfer, Draft, and Thickness. The
  compact typed `model.transform` capability now supplies Design Mirror,
  Design Linear Pattern, and Design Circular Pattern and is the shared contract
  boundary for the remaining Design transformations. The focused
  `model.surface` family now supplies Surface Filling, Geometric Fill,
  Sections, Extend Face, Curve on Mesh, and Blend Curve through one shared
  clean boundary. The default live Model provider surface currently serializes
  to 62,016 bytes, 3,520 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit, without
  opening any schema object. An incomplete
  ribbon still exposes zero Native tools; no legacy `core.*` tool leaks through
  that unavailable surface.
- Provider contracts now state exact current-document target/state
  prerequisites without publishing internal target-class names or duplicating
  operation prose. Required and optional fields remain mapped per operation.
  Physical quantities use unit-bearing field names or typed quantity objects;
  underlying CAD/VTK properties with ambiguous host names now carry explicit
  millimetre, inverse-millimetre, radian, pixel, or dimensionless descriptions.
  Default and maximum live graphs remain within their unchanged hard budgets.
- `SteveCADNativeTurn.py` freezes the exact human ribbon identity, ordered tool
  names, and canonical provider-schema digest without owning dispatch. It
  cannot start against the incomplete production registry; focused tests prove
  unchanged reauthorization and fail-closed invalidation for ribbon revision
  and schema changes. The module is 164 lines and remains separate from the
  registry and all domain execution modules.
- `SteveCADAuthoringMode.py` defines only `native | vibescript`, keeps unsaved
  choices in process memory, promotes the exact choice to the project manifest
  after first save, and restores saved choices without touching the CAD
  document. The service no longer hardcodes VibeScript. Build123d and OpenSCAD
  are rejected as authoring modes; the unrelated removed-workbench preference
  cleanup remains separate. The mode module is 143 lines.
- `SteveCADNativeState.py` owns monotonic per-document structural revisions,
  host-generated call tokens, stale preflight, bounded verified-result replay,
  and exact created/changed/deleted/replaced identities. Document observers
  count object creation, deletion, and structural property changes while
  filtering visibility, appearance, transient recompute pulses, selection,
  camera, tree, and UI events. It contains no tool execution.
  `SteveCADNativeStatePersistence.py` keeps atomic bounded state storage separate
  from the in-memory state machine. The state module is 681 lines. Four hundred
  twenty-five focused state, mode, Native domain, provider, VibeScript surface,
  registry, and guardrail tests pass; a clean GUI gate still reports the exact
  527-command default ribbon inventory.
- `SteveCADAuthoringModePolicy.py` contains the selector policy independently of
  Qt. The header exposes exactly VibeScript and Native, requires explicit human
  confirmation to take manual control, and fails closed during an assistant
  run, transaction, task/edit, recompute, unresolved editor work, or external
  MCP control. Separate clean-profile GUI gates prove those live blockers and
  prove first-save, close/reopen, changed-authority lockout, and independent
  multi-document mode restoration. Native remains disabled in production until
  the active ribbon registry is complete.
- `SteveCADNativeMutation.py` is the single immediate mutation runner. It
  reauthorizes the frozen ribbon before stale preflight, refuses nested
  transactions, buffers document-observer events until commit, recomputes only
  exact affected objects, requires a postcondition, and records one receipt.
  A real FreeCAD GUI gate proves one undo step, exact undo/redo, and rollback
  without a false authority change. The runner is 273 lines.
- `SteveCADNativeBackground.py` separately owns expensive detached preparation,
  bounded monotonic progress, cooperative cancellation, one active job per
  document, and document-thread commit dispatch. A Qt gate proves the event
  loop remains responsive, commit returns to the GUI/document thread, and
  closing a document cancels its active job. A frozen-turn test proves a ribbon
  change during preparation prevents commit. The manager is 350 lines.
- Exact target identity, active-domain snapshots, and common reads are split
  across `SteveCADNativeTargets.py`, `SteveCADNativeSnapshot.py`, eight narrow
  domain snapshot modules, `SteveCADNativeView.py`,
  `SteveCADNativeMeasure.py`, and `SteveCADNativeInspect.py`. Snapshots are rebuilt
  from the live document, contain only the active human-selected domain, include
  exact bounded selection when present, and never depend on a chat transcript.
- `SteveCADNativeDocument.py` is an 85-line guarded existing-path save and
  `SteveCADNativeUndo.py` is a 308-line session-only assistant-run history
  ledger. Local undo requires the exact FreeCAD transaction name, undo count,
  document revision, and current assistant run; it refuses unrelated human
  history and restores a failed undo attempt by redo before reporting failure.
  `SteveCADNativeApplicationManifest.py` separately classifies application-strip,
  document-tab, assistant, and debugger controls, with source-drift tests.
- A clean-profile FreeCAD GUI gate now proves real OCC distance, angle, radius,
  mass, element, and validity reads; direct Fit All and Isometric calls; grid
  and screenshot presentation without structural revision changes; guarded
  FCStd save; exact assistant-local undo; and refusal to undo a later human
  transaction. The gate now invokes the final five common provider schemas
  through `SteveCADNativeDispatch.py`, exact host-generated call tickets, and
  production common bindings rather than calling those helpers directly. The
  live gate also found and corrected the Python
  `Materials.Material.Name` handling needed to match the C++ Mass Properties
  default-density rule.
- Codex `callId` and Anthropic `tool_use.id` now reach the Native dispatcher
  unchanged. Duplicate provider calls replay the exact prior bounded result;
  reuse of an ID for another tool or argument set is refused. Native turn
  creation, provider-loop wrapping, provider context, registry assembly, and
  runtime assembly are separate 18–169-line modules. Normal failures contain
  only a short code, error, and actionable state fields; a separate debug sink
  receives internal diagnostics. The Native provider context contains one
  active-domain snapshot and optional exact selection, not legacy document,
  command, template, or workbench-pack summaries. A focused Native/provider/
  VibeScript guardrail run passes 492 tests, and the dispatcher-backed clean
  GUI gate reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_COMMON_GUI_OK`.
- The first Model capability slice uses `PartDesign::Component`, empty
  `PartDesign::Body`, standalone Design-history Sketches, global reusable
  SubShapeBinders, and `PartDesign::DesignClone`; it does not wrap GUI commands
  or revive obsolete Body-owned Sketch/reference semantics. Its schema,
  bindings, runtime routing, object algorithms, reusable-definition algorithms,
  and readiness reader are separate 12–246-line modules. A dispatcher-backed
  clean-profile gate proves invalid-input no-ops, Component and Body structure,
  base-plane and exact planar-face Sketch support without edit mode, read-only
  readiness, exact History reference resolution, clone output identity,
  per-operation undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_STRUCTURE_GUI_OK`.
- The Design primitive slice maps the nine current human primitive leaves to
  `PartDesign::DesignBox`, `DesignCylinder`, `DesignSphere`, `DesignCone`,
  `DesignEllipsoid`, `DesignTorus`, `DesignPrism`, `DesignWedge`, and
  `DesignTube`. Provider schemas, result/placement handling, primitive
  validation, runtime routing, and bindings remain separate 28–243-line
  modules. The implementation uses the native Design operation edit API and
  its exact current New Body, Join, Cut, and Intersect semantics. A separate
  497-line dispatcher-backed gate proves every primitive, explicit nontrivial
  placement, exact Component destination, invalid-input no-ops, Body-local
  downstream result frames, all four result modes, per-operation undo/redo,
  stable operation/Body identity, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PRIMITIVES_GUI_OK`.
- The Model profile slice maps the current Extrude, Revolve, Loft, Sweep, and
  Helix task controls directly onto global Design operations. It covers every
  current termination or definition mode, exact profile/axis/path/section/
  auxiliary references, taper, symmetric/reversed and handedness controls,
  sweep transition and orientation modes, and New Body/Join/Cut/Intersect
  results. Schema, input resolution, references, shared profile setup, and the
  five operation algorithms are split across focused 53–341-line modules. A
  dispatcher-backed 891-line clean-profile gate proves invalid-input no-ops,
  all current operation modes, the full five-by-four result matrix, exact
  undo/redo, and stable operation/Body IDs after FCStd save/reopen; it reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PROFILES_GUI_OK`. Target-dependent global Extrude and
  Revolve terminations now consume exactly one immutable Design input state
  instead of inventing a Body-owned BaseFeature. Three focused C++ lifecycle
  regressions, all 39 broader Design-modeling tests, and the full Part Design
  VibeScript API integration pass with that core behavior.
- The focused Hole slice uses the global `PartDesign::Hole` operation with
  exact reusable Sketch input rather than GUI command dispatch or a Body-owned
  compatibility path. Its 60–561-line schema, live metric thread/head catalog,
  bindings, runtime, and native algorithm modules cover circle/arc, point, and
  mixed profile interpretation; plain, clearance, tap-drill, cosmetic-thread,
  and modeled-thread geometry; none, counterbore, countersink, counterdrill,
  and live catalog head definitions; dimension and Through All depth; flat and
  angled drill points; straight/tapered and reversed controls; all current
  thread depth modes; left/right hand; thread fit/class; and signed custom
  modeled-thread clearance. A 675-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves
  invalid-schema and invalid-catalog no-ops, exact multi-Body targeting, native
  cutter and property postconditions, concise receipts, semantic undo/redo,
  stable operation/Body/input-state identity after FCStd save/reopen, and
  materially distinct modeled-thread geometry. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_HOLE_GUI_OK modeled_thread_seconds=2.025`; focused
  Native tests, all 39 Design-modeling tests, and the full Part Design
  VibeScript integration remain green.
- The focused Fillet slice uses the global `PartDesign::DesignFillet`
  operation and fixed Modify semantics. Its 53–148-line schema, bindings,
  runtime, native algorithm, and shared exact-target modules expose only the
  current task controls: exact Edge/Face groups across exact Bodies, the task's
  Use All Edges mode, and radius. The implementation preflights every Body
  state and topological element, calls the native Design operation target API,
  verifies exact target offsets/elements and output identities, and does not
  expose or create the retired Body-tip Base/BaseFeature path. A 424-line
  dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves invalid-schema and invalid-element no-ops,
  multi-Body edges, face-boundary filleting, all-sharp-edge filleting, concise
  receipts, semantic undo/redo, impossible-radius kernel rollback, and stable
  operation/Body/input identities after FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_FILLET_GUI_OK`; all 39 Design-modeling tests and the
  full Part Design VibeScript integration remain green.
- The focused Chamfer slice uses the global `PartDesign::DesignChamfer`
  operation with the same fixed Modify and exact-target contract. Its
  53–242-line schema, shared targeting, bindings, runtime, and native algorithm
  modules cover all current task controls: equal distance, two distances,
  distance and angle, flip direction where enabled, explicit Edge/Face groups
  across exact Bodies, and Use All Edges. The parser and verifier reject
  inactive-mode fields, non-finite/bool-as-number inputs, stale topology,
  mismatched target offsets/elements, invalid output solids, and any retired
  Base/BaseFeature link. A 561-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves invalid
  schema and invalid-element no-ops, atomic multi-Body modification, Face
  boundary selection, every definition mode, both flip states, Use All Edges,
  concise receipts, semantic undo/redo, impossible-size kernel rollback, and
  exact operation/Body/input/property identity after FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_CHAMFER_GUI_OK`; 248 focused Native tests, all
  39 Design-modeling tests, 222 VibeScript surface/guardrail tests, the Fillet
  regression gate, and the full Part Design VibeScript integration remain
  green.
- The focused Draft slice uses the global `PartDesign::DesignDraft` operation
  and fixed Modify semantics. Its 96–342-line schema, shared face targeting,
  runtime, and native algorithm modules cover every current task control:
  exact Face groups across exact Bodies, draft angle, reverse pull direction,
  automatic neutral-plane/pull inference, datum/sketch object references, and
  exact planar Face or linear Edge references. User-visible Body references
  resolve through `resolveDesignDefinitionSubelementReference` to immutable
  pre-operation History states; global Design controllers are never treated as
  legacy shape features. Preflight rejects stale/nonplanar/nonlinear geometry,
  and verification freezes canonical reference identities and captured
  Component frames. A 649-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves invalid
  schema and invalid-face no-ops, atomic multi-Body drafting in different
  Component frames, automatic and reversed drafting, object and subelement
  reference modes, concise receipts, semantic undo/redo, invalid geometric
  relationship rollback, unchanged accepted geometry and frames after moving
  the source Component, and exact operation/Body/input/reference/property
  identity after FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DRAFT_GUI_OK`; 255 focused Native tests, all 39
  Design-modeling tests, 222 VibeScript surface/guardrail tests, the Fillet and
  Chamfer regression gates, and the full Part Design VibeScript integration
  remain green.
- The focused Thickness slice uses the global `PartDesign::DesignThickness`
  operation with fixed Modify semantics and no inherited Body-tip Base or
  BaseFeature link. Its 117–251-line schema/runtime modules and focused
  173-line algorithm expose every current task control: exact Face groups
  across exact Bodies, positive thickness, inward/outward direction, Skin,
  Pipe, and RectoVerso modes, Arc/Intersection joins, and intersection
  handling. Preflight rejects stale or non-Face topology before a transaction;
  verification freezes exact target offsets/elements, control values, input
  state and Body identities, and valid one-solid outputs. A 493-line
  dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves invalid-schema and invalid-face no-ops,
  atomic two-Body shelling, both directions, all three modes, both joins, both
  intersection-handling states, concise receipts, semantic undo/redo,
  impossible-thickness kernel rollback, and exact operation/Body/input/control
  identity after FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_THICKNESS_GUI_OK`; all four dress-up regression gates,
  268 focused Native tests, all 39 Design-modeling tests, 224 VibeScript
  surface/engine guardrails, and the full Part Design VibeScript integration
  remain green. The complete registered Model schema set is 52,728 bytes,
  below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- The Design Mirror slice adds the first compact typed `model.transform`
  pattern definition instead of exposing one wide tool per transformation.
  Its 47–397-line schema/runtime/source/algorithm modules distinguish one
  exact Body copy from one earlier additive or subtractive Design feature
  applied to 1–16 exact target Bodies. Result semantics are derived by the
  Design kernel: Body mode publishes one independently identified Body in the
  source Component, while Feature mode preserves Join or Cut on the exact
  target Bodies. Mirror planes support bounded numeric origin/normal vectors,
  datum or sketch planes, sketch `N_Axis`, and exact planar Faces resolved to
  immutable pre-operation History state. Verification freezes source,
  target, input-state, output-Body, reference, occurrence, result, and captured
  Component-frame identity. A 652-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves
  invalid-schema and stale-face no-ops, numeric and every supported reference
  form, independent Body output bounds, multi-Body additive and subtractive
  Feature modes, a moved-Component reference frame, concise receipts,
  semantic undo/redo, disconnected-addition kernel rollback, and stable
  operation/Body/input/reference identities after FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_MIRROR_GUI_OK`; all nine current Model
  lifecycle gates, 282 focused Native tests, all 39 Design-modeling tests, 224
  VibeScript surface/engine guardrails, and the full Part Design VibeScript
  integration remain green. The complete registered schema set is 55,608
  bytes, 9,928 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- The Design Linear Pattern slice extends the same typed `model.transform`
  pattern contract with positive bounded spacing, 2–10,000 total occurrences,
  centered ordering, and exact directions from a nonzero numeric vector, datum
  axis, sketch, built-in or construction sketch axis, or straight Edge.
  Direction references retain the immutable pre-operation History object and
  captured Component frame. Body mode publishes exactly `occurrences - 1`
  independently identified Bodies beside the source; Feature mode preserves
  the source operation's fixed Join or Cut semantics across 1–16 exact target
  Bodies. The 434-line algorithm verifies occurrence counts, source and target
  state, output identity, result mode, spacing, centering, reference and frame,
  and valid one-solid results. A 701-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves
  invalid-schema and stale-Edge no-ops, uncentered and centered Body ordering,
  sketch-object, `H_Axis`, and real construction `Axis0` directions, a straight
  Edge in a moved Component, multi-Body additive and subtractive Feature modes,
  concise receipts, semantic undo/redo, disconnected-addition kernel rollback,
  and stable operation/Body/input/reference identities after FCStd save/reopen.
  It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_LINEAR_PATTERN_GUI_OK`; all ten Model
  lifecycle gates, 294 focused Native tests, all 39 Design-modeling tests, 237
  VibeScript surface/engine/timeline guardrails, and the full Part Design
  VibeScript integration remain green. The complete registered Model schema set
  is 56,975 bytes, 8,561 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- The Design Circular Pattern slice adds the last shipped standalone Design
  pattern to the same typed `model.transform` contract. It exposes exactly the
  current task controls: numeric or referenced axis, positive angular extent up
  to 360 degrees, 2–10,000 total occurrences, and reversal. Exact axes support
  datum axes, sketches, built-in and construction sketch axes, and straight or
  circular Edges while retaining the immutable pre-operation History object and
  captured Component frame. The kernel preserves its distinct distribution
  rule: a full circle excludes a duplicate 360-degree source occurrence, while
  a partial angle includes both endpoints. Body mode publishes exactly
  `occurrences - 1` independently identified Bodies; Feature mode preserves
  fixed Join or Cut semantics across 1–16 exact target Bodies. The 464-line
  algorithm verifies occurrence count, source and target state, output identity,
  result mode, axis/reference/frame, angle, reversal, and valid one-solid
  results. A 779-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate proves invalid-schema and
  stale-Edge no-ops, full-circle and partial/reversed ordering, sketch-object,
  `H_Axis`, and real construction `Axis0` references, a circular Edge in a moved
  Component, multi-Body additive and subtractive Feature modes, concise
  receipts, semantic undo/redo, disconnected-addition kernel rollback, and
  stable operation/Body/input/reference identities after FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_CIRCULAR_PATTERN_GUI_OK`; all eleven
  Model lifecycle gates, 308 focused Native tests, all 39 Design-modeling tests,
  237 VibeScript surface/engine/timeline guardrails, and the full Part Design
  VibeScript integration remain green. The complete registered Model schema set
  is 58,640 bytes, 6,896 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- The proven live Model action graph contains Design Mirror, Design Linear
  Pattern, and Design Circular Pattern, but no Design Multi-transform action.
  Step 9.29 is therefore complete without registering or reviving the retired
  `PartDesign_MultiTransform` command; the action-manifest drift gates will make
  a future shipped addition fail closed until it receives an explicit contract.
- The standalone Part Primitive slice is based on the real creation-mode task
  panel rather than the legacy edit pages still present in `DlgPrimitives.ui`.
  Its eight live choices are Plane, Helix, Spiral, Circle, Ellipse, Point, Line,
  and Regular polygon; Body-owned Box/Cylinder/Cone/Sphere/Ellipsoid/Torus/
  Prism/Wedge creation remains solely on the Design primitive path. The focused
  `model.part` `primitive` variant has exact closed definitions, bounded
  placement, native angle/enumeration handling, and cross-parameter preflight.
  The 42–350-line schema/runtime/binding/algorithm modules publish one root
  `Part` object as a durable Design definition with stable definition and Design
  identities. The 493-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate opens the actual human
  dialog to freeze those eight choices, exercises every kind plus both helix
  hands, tapered and untapered curves, partial/full arcs, explicit transformed
  placement, schema and kernel no-ops, concise receipts, exact undo/redo,
  postcondition rollback, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_PRIMITIVES_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Shape Builder slice extends the same focused `model.part`
  capability with one compact `builder` variant for the six modes proven from
  the live task panel: Edge from vertices, Wire from edges, Face from vertices,
  Face from edges, Shell from faces, and Solid from shell. The contract exposes
  exactly the creation controls that affect results: Planar for either Face
  path, All Faces and Refine for Shell, and Refine for Solid. It accepts bounded
  exact object/subelement groups, rejects wrong or stale current-History
  geometry before a transaction, copies shell input before solid construction,
  and leaves every source byte-for-byte unchanged. The 350-line algorithm
  prepares kernel geometry read-only, then publishes one static root
  `Part::Feature` as a durable Design definition in one guarded transaction.
  Verification proves the exact partnered shape, orientation, placement,
  topology, stable identities, and concise length/area/volume receipt. The
  624-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the six human modes and their
  control-enablement matrix, exercises planar and filled faces through both
  input paths, explicit and all-face shells, refined and unrefined solids,
  multi-object exact targets, schema/stale/kernel no-ops, source immutability,
  exact rollback, undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_BUILDER_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Extrude slice extends `model.part` with the complete live
  retained-dialog contract: one to 32 exact current-History sources; normal,
  custom-vector, or exact straight-edge direction; independent forward and
  reverse lengths and taper angles; symmetric and reversed direction; and
  solid or shell output. The 109–572-line runtime/schema/algorithm modules
  resolve current modeling state before mutation, use native
  `Part::Extrusion` properties, publish multiple outputs as one durable Design
  definition with owned History resources, preserve exact replacement inputs,
  and return one concise grouped receipt. The 677-line dispatcher-backed GUI
  gate freezes the real task-panel controls and enablement matrix and proves
  normal/custom/edge modes, zero-length edge-magnitude semantics, taper,
  reversal, symmetry, multi-source grouping, invalid/stale/nonplanar/curved
  no-ops, source immutability, forced rollback, exact undo/redo, and FCStd
  save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_EXTRUDE_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Revolve slice extends `model.part` with every live
  retained-dialog control: one to 32 exact current-History sources; a custom
  center/direction or an exact whole-object/EdgeN line or circular reference;
  signed angle, symmetric angle, and solid/shell output. Shared current-History
  resolution is isolated in a 194-line Part helper while the Revolve algorithm
  remains 418 lines. It creates real `Part::Revolution` objects and preserves
  native circular-reference zero-angle inheritance, grouped Design/History
  publication, replacement inputs, source and axis immutability, and concise
  receipts. The 701-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the real task-panel
  labels, defaults, preselection, and control enablement and proves custom,
  exact line, exact circular-arc, whole-edge, negative, symmetric, solid/shell,
  and multi-source cases; schema/stale/solid/invalid-axis no-ops; forced
  rollback; exact undo/redo; and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_REVOLVE_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Mirror slice extends `model.part` with the complete live
  retained-dialog contract: one to 32 exact current-History shape sources,
  including solids and solid-bearing compounds; XY, XZ, and YZ planes with an
  explicit base point; and one exact current plane-object, planar FaceN, or
  circular EdgeN reference, with the native whole-object single-face or
  single-edge inference rules. Its 247-line shared History resolver and
  462-line Mirror algorithm create real `Part::Mirroring` objects, preserve
  transformed source placement and copied Part visuals, publish multi-source
  results as one durable Design definition with owned History resources, keep
  exact replacement inputs and reference geometry immutable, and return one
  concise grouped receipt. The dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the actual
  task-panel labels, defaults, preselection, selector state, and reference
  behavior and proves all three fixed planes, a real `Part::Plane`, explicit
  and inferred planar/circular references, transformed solid, compound, wire,
  and multi-source outputs, repeated-recompute stability, schema/stale/
  nonplanar/noncircular/ambiguous no-ops, forced rollback, exact undo/redo, and
  FCStd save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_MIRROR_GUI_OK`.
- The Body-aware Design Scale slice extends the existing compact
  `model.transform` family with the exact live `PartDesign_Scale` contract:
  one to 16 explicit current-History Bodies, uniform or independent Design-axis
  factors from `1e-6` through `1e6`, and one fixed Design-space center. The
  119–305-line schema/runtime/algorithm modules resolve each Body through the
  authoritative modeling-state resolver, freeze the exact state, Body identity,
  shape, and Component frame before mutation, and create one global
  `PartDesign::DesignScale` with fixed Modify semantics. Verification proves
  unchanged input/output frames, one output per Body, exact previous-input and
  presence ports, valid single-solid results, a null controller Shape, and no
  duplicate `Part::Scale`. The 815-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the
  actual human task panel's Body preselection, defaults, factor bounds, and
  uniform/non-uniform enablement; proves atomic two-Body uniform scaling,
  independent-axis scaling, a moved-Component Design-frame case, concise exact
  receipts, immutable prior states, schema/type/empty/current-History no-ops,
  forced postcondition rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute, and FCStd
  save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_SCALE_GUI_OK`; all three
  existing Design pattern lifecycle gates remain green.
- The standalone Face From Wires slice extends `model.part` without inventing
  controls absent from the human command: one to 32 whole-object exact
  current-History sources, no existing faces, at least one wire per source,
  and every discovered wire closed. The 184–452-line runtime/schema modules
  route one compact `make_face` variant into a focused 221-line algorithm that
  creates a real parametric `Part::Face`, fixes `FaceMakerClass` to the live
  `Part::FaceMakerUnified` behavior, retains ordered exact `Sources`, publishes
  one root Design definition, hides only visible replaced presentations, and
  returns only root, source/topology counts, shape type, and area. The 596-line
  dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the actual immediate-command activation
  predicate and proves a single face, a face with a hole assembled from two
  sources, disjoint compound faces, transformed-placement output, exact source
  immutability, schema/stale/empty/open-wire/existing-face/current-History
  no-ops, forced postcondition rollback, repeated recompute, exact undo/redo,
  and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_MAKE_FACE_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Ruled Surface slice extends `model.part` with the exact
  source-preserving `Part_RuledSurface` command contract: exactly two ordered
  current-History curves, each either a whole Edge/Wire object or one exact
  EdgeN/WireN subelement, including two distinct subelements of one owner. No
  orientation control is invented because the human command fixes the real
  `Part::RuledSurface` feature to `Automatic`. The 204-line algorithm and
  209–496-line runtime/schema modules freeze both transformed curves before
  mutation, retain exact `Curve1`/`Curve2` links, publish one root Design
  definition, deliberately leave both sources visible, and reject replacement
  metadata. The 636-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the actual human
  selection predicate and proves same-object subedges, two whole edges, closed
  wires, transformed placements, exact kernel-equivalent geometry, schema/
  stale/face/compound/current-History no-ops, source immutability, forced
  rollback, repeated recompute, exact undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_RULED_SURFACE_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Loft slice extends `model.part` with the retained human
  task's exact contract: two to 32 ordered current-History profiles, each a
  whole Vertex/Edge/Wire/Face object or one exact VertexN/EdgeN/WireN/FaceN
  subelement, including multiple ordered subprofiles from one owner. The only
  provider controls are the live Solid, Ruled, and Closed checkboxes;
  `MaxDegree=5` and `Linearize=false` remain fixed implementation behavior.
  The focused 303-line algorithm creates one real root-level `Part::Loft`,
  retains exact `Sections` and grouped `ProfileLinks`, publishes one Design
  definition, records and hides only visible replaced presentations, and
  returns a concise geometry receipt. The 753-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate
  freezes human preselection order, labels, and defaults and proves solid,
  ruled, same-owner exact-subelement, transformed-placement, and meaningful
  closed-loop output; schema/stale/invalid-shape/current-History no-ops; source
  immutability; forced rollback; exact undo/redo; repeated recompute; and FCStd
  save/reopen. The Loft/Sweep view provider now claims each source once in
  stable order, eliminating duplicate tree children without changing stored
  links. The gate reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_LOFT_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Sweep slice extends `model.part` with the retained human
  task's exact contract: one to 32 ordered current-History profiles, each a
  whole Vertex/Edge/Wire/Face object or one exact VertexN/EdgeN/WireN/FaceN
  subelement, plus one whole Edge/Wire/connected edge-or-wire compound path or
  one to 64 ordered exact EdgeN path subelements. The provider exposes only the
  live Create solid and Frenet checkboxes; `Transition="Right corner"` and
  `Linearize=false` remain fixed task behavior. The focused 400-line algorithm
  creates one real root-level `Part::Sweep`, retains exact `Sections`, grouped
  `ProfileLinks`, and `Spine`, publishes one Design definition, records and
  hides only visible replaced presentations, and returns a concise topology
  receipt. Exact current-History snapshots now retain an exact BREP digest in
  addition to OCC partner identity, so an unchanged transformed wrapper that
  OCC reconstructs at transaction start remains valid while any geometry,
  placement, orientation, object, or subelement change is still rejected. The
  875-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes human preselection, labels, and
  defaults and proves solid, non-solid, same-owner multisection, exact
  multi-edge path, transformed-placement, and whole-compound-path output;
  schema/stale/invalid/disconnected/current-History no-ops; source immutability;
  forced rollback; exact undo/redo; repeated recompute; unique stable tree
  children; and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_SWEEP_GUI_OK`; the Loft, Ruled Surface, and Part
  Mirror lifecycle gates remain green after the shared exact-target change.
- The standalone Part Section slice introduces the focused `model.boolean`
  family instead of continuing to grow `model.part`. Its only current variant
  accepts exactly two ordered whole-object current-History operands, matching
  the immediate human command's Base/Tool order and deliberately exposing no
  subelement, approximation, or refine controls. The 202-line algorithm
  creates one real root-level `Part::Section`, fixes `Approximation=false`,
  preserves the native object's current user-level Refine default, copies the
  first operand's line material, retains exact Base/Tool links, records and
  hides visible replaced presentations, and returns only result topology,
  length, and actual refine state. Its schema, runtime, and binding remain
  separate 44–62-line modules. The 611-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes
  the actual immediate-command activation and display contract and proves
  overlapping solids, solid/plane curves, transformed placements, compound
  operands, and the human command's valid empty disjoint result; schema/stale/
  null-shape/current-History no-ops; exact preflight change rejection; source
  BREP immutability; forced rollback; exact undo/redo; repeated recompute; and
  FCStd save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_SECTION_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Cross Sections slice extends the focused `model.part`
  family with the retained `Part::CrossSections` feature instead of a
  destructive shape copy or an AI-only slicing approximation. It accepts 1–32
  unique current-History source owners, preserving either each whole source or
  1–64 ordered exact Vertex/Edge/Wire/Face/Shell/Solid/CompSolid/Compound
  subelements. Its closed distribution contract exposes every live human
  control: XY/XZ/YZ plane, signed position, single or repeated sections,
  nonnegative spacing, count, and both-sides centering. Provider-created series
  are deliberately capped at 10,000 planes, consistent with Native pattern
  occurrence limits, while the exact human plane-position formula is retained.
  The 350-line algorithm creates one linked `Part::CrossSections` per selected
  owner, validates every result before publication, publishes all outputs as
  one Design block, preserves source geometry and visibility, and returns only
  grouped topology and length facts. Its 702-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate
  freezes the real task panel's activation, defaults, controls, and accepted
  output, then proves whole sources, exact compound subelements, multi-source
  batches, centered series, transformed placement, schema/stale/invalid/
  no-intersection/current-History no-ops, preflight change rejection, forced
  rollback, source BREP immutability, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute, and
  FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_CROSS_SECTIONS_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part 3D Offset slice adds one retained `Part::Offset` through
  `model.part`. Its whole-object current-History target and closed definition
  expose every final-geometry task control: signed distance, Skin/Pipe/
  RectoVerso mode, Arc/Tangent/Intersection join, intersection handling,
  self-intersection handling, and fill. The preview-only Update View checkbox
  remains human task-panel behavior rather than a meaningless provider field.
  The 241-line algorithm preserves the exact Source link, copies the human
  command's shape/line/point presentation, records and hides only a visible
  replaced presentation, publishes one root Design definition, and returns a
  concise topology/area/volume receipt. The 656-line dispatcher-backed GUI
  gate freezes actual activation, labels, choices, defaults, source hiding,
  and accepted output; proves every mode and boolean control, Arc and
  Intersection success, the OCC kernel's explicit Tangent rejection, filled
  face output, negative distance, transformed placement, schema/stale/null/
  current-History no-ops, exact preflight change rejection, forced rollback,
  source geometry and placement preservation, exact undo/redo, repeated
  recompute, presentation transfer, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_OFFSET_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part 2D Offset slice reuses the same focused retained-offset
  lifecycle while keeping a narrower truthful `Part::Offset2D` contract. It
  accepts one exact current-History whole shape only when transformed geometry
  is planar and contains no solid, exposes signed distance, Skin/Pipe, all
  three live join choices, intersection handling, and fill, and omits the
  hidden self-intersection and unsupported RectoVerso controls. The shared
  offset implementation remains 325 lines. Its 577-line dispatcher-backed GUI
  gate freezes the actual command eligibility, Pipe default, two visible
  modes, three joins, hidden self-intersection control, preview default,
  source hiding, and accepted result; proves Skin and Pipe, Arc/Tangent/
  Intersection, both intersection and fill states, negative distance, open and
  closed wires, faces, transformed planar placement, stale/null/solid/
  nonplanar/current-History no-ops, exact preflight change rejection, forced
  rollback, source geometry and placement preservation, exact undo/redo,
  repeated recompute, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_OFFSET_2D_GUI_OK`.
- The Projection on Surface slice adds one retained
  `Part::ProjectOnSurface` through `model.part`. Its closed contract accepts
  exactly one current-History target face, 1–64 distinct exact Edge/Wire/Face
  sources, All/Faces/Edges output mode, bounded nonnegative extrusion height,
  signed solid-depth offset, and one explicit bounded nonzero direction. The
  runtime normalizes that direction rather than exposing the human-only camera
  and axis-button controls. The 291-line algorithm retains exact SupportFace
  and ordered Projection links, preserves all source geometry, placement, and
  visibility, publishes one root Design definition without claiming replaced
  inputs, and returns only source count plus topology/area/volume facts. Its
  757-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the real command's blank
  provisional feature, role buttons, modes, ranges, defaults, direction
  controls, and cancel cleanup; proves All/Faces/Edges, extrusion, positive and
  negative offsets, normalized direction, ordered multiple sources,
  transformed placements, schema/stale/null/invalid-element/zero-direction/
  no-projection/current-History no-ops, exact preflight change rejection,
  forced rollback, source-preserving visibility, exact undo/redo, repeated
  recompute, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_PROJECTION_GUI_OK`.
- The standalone Part Compound slice maps `Part_Compound` to one retained
  root-level `Part::Compound`. Its closed contract accepts 1–64 ordered,
  distinct current-History whole shapes and exposes no subelement, refinement,
  or synthetic merge controls. The 197-line algorithm retains the exact Links
  list, resolves transformed current geometry, records only presentations that
  were visible as replaced inputs, preserves already-hidden inputs, validates
  one real Compound output, and returns only source count plus topology/area/
  volume facts. Its 606-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the actual
  selection-dependent immediate command, ordered Links, tree children, input
  hiding, and one-step undo; proves one and multiple sources, ordered mixed
  Vertex/Edge/Face/Solid inputs, transformed and nested Compound inputs,
  visible and hidden presentations, schema/duplicate/stale/null/current-
  History no-ops, exact preflight change rejection, forced rollback, source
  geometry and placement preservation, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute,
  and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_COMPOUND_GUI_OK`.
- The Compound separation slice follows the shipped ribbon action
  `PartDesign_Separate`, not the obsolete workbench-only explode command. Its
  closed `model.structure` variant accepts one exact active reusable
  Design-root multi-solid definition, one explicit optional destination
  Component, and the visible operation label; it exposes no subelement,
  refinement, selection, or raw-command escape hatch. The 481-line algorithm
  rejects Bodies, Links, grouped features, Design operations, single-solid
  definitions, inactive History, missing targets, and non-Components before
  mutation. It finalizes an uncommitted reusable source exactly as the human
  command does, creates one retained `PartDesign::DesignSeparate`, preserves
  stable Body IDs and region witnesses, copies physical material and the full
  shape/line/point/transparency/display presentation to every output, records
  and hides the replaced source, and returns only the operation, source,
  destination when present, Body references, count, and volumes. Its 663-line
  dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the real immediate command and its edit
  summary/output controls; proves root and Component-owned output, transformed
  mixed solids, local output frames versus Design-space preview geometry,
  material and appearance preservation, schema/missing/single-solid/Body/
  Design-operation/non-Component/group/Link/inactive-History no-ops, exact
  preflight change rejection, forced postcondition rollback including source
  publication and visibility, stable IDs/witnesses across recompute and exact
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_SEPARATE_GUI_OK`. Its exact global-geometry
  postcondition compares mass properties and full boolean-intersection volume,
  not OCC's representation-dependent curved bounding boxes. No Native mapping
  or runtime path for legacy `Part_ExplodeCompound` was added.
- The Compound Filter slice maps the shipped `Part_CompoundFilter` action to a
  retained root-level `Part::FeaturePython` using the real
  `CompoundTools.CompoundFilter` proxy. Its compact closed `model.part`
  contract accepts one exact current-History Compound or CompSolid and exposes
  seven typed modes: bypass, specific-item selectors, collision, and volume,
  area, length, or distance windows. Specific items use bounded integer or
  two-/three-field slice selectors rather than raw filter grammar; collision
  and distance require an exact stencil; window modes use bounded percentages,
  an optional positive maximum override, and explicit inversion. The 568-line
  implementation validates the mode-specific field set before document
  preflight, evaluates the exact `Base.Shape` and optional `Stencil.Shape` used
  by the retained proxy, bounds synchronous work to 4,096 direct children,
  rejects empty results before mutation, preserves the durable native filter
  controls, records and hides only visible replaced presentations, publishes
  one root Design definition, and returns only mode, child counts, and useful
  topology/area/volume facts. Its 792-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes
  the real command's selection rules, one-selection volume default,
  two-selection collision default, immediate creation, retained controls, and
  tree children; proves all seven modes, typed index/slice selection and
  inversion, optional and required stencils, transformed sources, mixed child
  topology, maximum overrides, hidden-presentation preservation, schema/
  missing/non-Compound/out-of-range/no-output/current-History no-ops, exact
  preflight change rejection, forced rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated
  recompute, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_COMPOUND_FILTER_GUI_OK`.
- The Design Combine slice maps the single shipped `PartDesign_Combine` action
  to one compact `model.boolean` variant covering each human task mode: Join,
  Cut, and Intersect. Its closed contract accepts one exact result Body, 1–15
  ordered distinct tool Bodies, explicit tool-preservation intent, and the
  visible operation label; it exposes no generic Boolean command, selection,
  refinement, fuzzy-tolerance, or raw-dispatch controls. The 381-line retained
  implementation requires one active current solid state and distinct
  persistent identity per Body, freezes each exact state and global frame,
  calls the native `PartDesign.setDesignCombineBodies` edit API, preserves the
  operation's human defaults, publishes the exact result/absence ports, and
  returns only the mode, tool-preservation state, and useful Body presence and
  volume facts. Its 839-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the actual
  first-selected result role, ordered tool roles, Join default, Join/Cut/
  Intersect selector, Keep tool Bodies control, preview, and cancel behavior;
  proves consuming Join, preserving three-Body Join, Cut, preserving
  Intersect, cross-Component frames, schema/missing/wrong-type/empty/inactive-
  History/disjoint-geometry no-ops, exact preflight change rejection, forced
  postcondition rollback, exact one-step undo/redo, repeated recompute, and
  durable ports, shapes, Body identities, absence states, and frames across
  FCStd save/reopen. It also verifies that `PreviewShape` follows its declared
  transient lifecycle rather than treating it as saved model state. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_COMBINE_GUI_OK`.
- The authoritative 75-action Model inventory contains no Boolean Fragments,
  XOR, standalone Fuse, or standalone Common leaf action. The only shipped
  general Boolean leaf is `PartDesign_Combine`, whose Join, Cut, and Intersect
  modes are covered above. Conditional row 9.51 therefore requires no extra
  provider operation or compatibility alias.
- The Part Join slice maps the three shipped leaves `Part_JoinConnect`,
  `Part_JoinEmbed`, and `Part_JoinCutout` to three exact operations in one
  focused `model.join` family; the composite `Part_CompJoinFeatures` remains a
  human menu and is never advertised as a provider operation. Connect accepts
  1–32 ordered distinct exact current-History whole shapes, allowing one source
  only when it is a Compound with at least two direct children; preflight
  expands and bounds nested compounds to 256 non-Compound leaves, rejects
  vertices and mixed dimensions, and uses the exact linked `Shape` consumed by
  the retained proxy. Embed and Cutout require an ordered exact base and tool.
  All three expose only their durable Refine and bounded Tolerance controls and
  visible label. The 361-line implementation uses the real
  `BOPTools.JoinFeatures` factories and proxies, preserves ordered global
  links and view-provider tree children, records and hides only visible input
  presentations, publishes one root Design operation, validates exact inputs
  again before mutation and commit, and returns concise operation, topology,
  area, and volume facts. Its 792-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate freezes the
  actual immediate human commands, default controls, ordered roles, automatic
  labels, multi-source and single-Compound Connect paths, and tree children;
  proves refined and tolerance-aware Connect, Embed and Cutout, transformed
  sources, initially hidden input preservation, schema/duplicate/missing/null/
  single-source/mixed-dimension/inactive-History no-ops, exact preflight change
  rejection, forced postcondition rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated
  recompute, and durable proxy types, links, identities, replacement metadata,
  visibility, and shapes across FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_JOIN_GUI_OK`. OCC can vary a repeated general-fuse
  cylinder bound by 0.0024 mm with identical topology, area, and volume, so the
  gate uses the existing 0.005-mm geometric comparison tolerance while keeping
  identity, controls, topology, and roles exact.
- The Split slice maps only the shipped `PartDesign_Split` leaf to the `split`
  variant of the compact `model.boolean` family. Legacy `Part_Slice`,
  `Part_SliceApart`, Boolean Fragments, and XOR paths are absent from the live
  Model manifest and received no aliases or compatibility runtime. The closed
  contract accepts one exact active source Body, 1–32 ordered distinct exact
  Body or reusable Part definitions, 0–64 exact Face/Shell/Solid subelements
  per definition with 256 total, one explicit retained-region index, and the
  visible label. The 687-line implementation freezes the source state, stable
  Body and Component identities, frames, exact definition shapes, and selected
  subelements before mutation; calls the native
  `PartDesign.setDesignSplitDefinition` and
  `PartDesign.assignDesignSplitRegions` edit APIs; preserves the human-only
  Refine and FuzzyTolerance defaults; requires 2–256 valid solid regions; keeps
  the selected region on the source Body identity; gives every other region a
  stable new Body identity and strict interior witness; and verifies exact
  input/output ports, frames, predecessor state, presence, volume partition,
  and Design validity. Its concise result contains only the operation, source,
  splitter count, retained index, and useful per-region Body/witness/volume
  facts. The 900-line dispatcher-backed real GUI gate freezes the actual source
  selector, definition add/remove list, retained-region selector, accept, and
  cancel behavior; proves both retained sides, three-way splitting, exact
  subelements, Body-backed solid definitions, transformed frames, schema/type/
  empty/self/inactive-History/non-dividing/out-of-range no-ops, stale preflight
  rejection, forced verifier rollback, one-step undo/redo, recompute, and exact
  identities, ports, witnesses, and shapes across FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_DESIGN_SPLIT_GUI_OK`.
- The Defeaturing slice maps only the shipped immediate
  `Part_Defeaturing` action to the `defeature` variant of the compact
  `model.part` family. Its closed contract accepts 1–32 distinct exact current-
  History whole-shape sources, 1–64 distinct exact `FaceN` selections per
  source, 256 faces total, and the visible label. The 374-line implementation
  groups faces by source, freezes and heals every exact global source shape
  before mutation, creates one root-level `Part::Feature` per source in one
  transaction, publishes the human-equivalent resource/root timeline block,
  and hides only presentations that were visible. Durable replacement metadata
  and receipts retain exact History states rather than mutable Body
  presentations, while the Body remains the presentation hidden from the
  human. Creation and commit both prove unchanged sources, exact preflight
  output identity, valid healed solids, labels, timeline ownership, Design
  identity, replacement metadata, and presentation visibility. The concise
  result reports only root identity, source/result/resource and removed-face
  counts, output shape types, topology, area, and volume. Its 772-line
  dispatcher-backed real GUI gate freezes actual human multi-source selection,
  automatic labels, publication, visibility, and one-step undo; proves exact
  Native single/multi-face and multi-source execution, initially hidden input
  preservation, transformed and Body-backed sources, schema/missing/invalid/
  duplicate/inactive-History no-ops, stale-preflight rejection, forced verifier
  rollback, exact undo/redo, recompute, and durable identities, roles,
  ownership, shapes, replacement states, and Design IDs across FCStd
  save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_PART_DEFEATURE_GUI_OK`.
- The Surface Filling slice maps only the shipped `Surface_Filling` action to
  the `filling` variant of the new focused `model.surface` family. Its compact,
  closed contract accepts one ordered array of 1–256 exact current-History
  constraints with explicit boundary-edge, non-boundary curve, free-face, and
  point kinds; exact optional adjacent support faces and C0/G1/G2 continuity;
  one optional exact initial face; the visible label; and every bounded native
  solver control. Omitted controls use the exact human defaults: degree 3, 15
  points per curve, two iterations, isotropy, 1e-5/1e-4 2D/3D tolerances, 0.01
  angular tolerance, 0.1 curvature tolerance, maximum degree 8, and nine
  segments. The 564-line implementation validates each kind's exact field set,
  subelement type, support-face adjacency, distinct resolved History state,
  degree relationship, and one connected closed boundary before mutation;
  creates the retained native `Surface::Filling`; preserves ordered exact
  links and source presentation visibility; publishes one root Design
  definition; and verifies every link, continuity, control, output Face,
  timeline role, Design identity, and unchanged input again before commit. Its
  concise result reports root identity, constraint counts, initial-face state,
  core degree/segmentation controls, and useful surface area/topology facts.
  The 886-line dispatcher-backed real GUI gate exercises actual human create,
  automatic add-edge mode, adjacent Face1/G1 editing, accept, cancel, defaults,
  and undo; proves Native defaults and every solver control, every constraint
  kind, support/initial faces, transformed and Body-backed exact History
  sources, initially hidden input preservation, malformed/missing/open/
  nonadjacent/duplicate/inactive-History no-ops, stale-preflight rejection,
  forced verifier rollback, exact undo/redo, recompute, and durable links,
  controls, identities, shapes, and visibility across FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_FILLING_GUI_OK`.
- The Geometric Fill Surface slice maps only the shipped
  `Surface_GeomFillSurface` action to the `geometric_fill` variant of the
  focused `model.surface` family. Its compact, closed contract accepts two to
  four ordered, distinct exact current-History Part edges; one explicit
  reversal flag per edge; the visible label; and the native Stretched, Coons,
  or Curved filling style. Omitted style uses the exact human Stretched
  default. The 249-line implementation resolves and freezes every exact edge
  before mutation, rejects duplicate resolved History states, creates the
  retained native `Surface::GeomFillSurface`, preserves the exact ordered
  `BoundaryList`, `ReversedList`, native `FillType`, and all source
  presentations, publishes one root Design definition, and verifies the links,
  controls, output Face, timeline role, Design identity, and unchanged inputs
  again before commit. Its concise result reports only root identity, boundary,
  style, and reversal counts, output edge count, and surface area. The audit
  also found and corrected a shipped human-command invariant defect: a new
  feature's orientation list contained one phantom default flag, so edge
  reversal was ignored whenever the list and boundary counts differed. New
  features now start with an empty orientation list, and the Surface command
  regression proves exactly one persisted flag per selected edge. The 715-line
  dispatcher-backed real GUI gate exercises actual human automatic add-edge
  mode, all four selections, double-click reversal, style selection, accept,
  cancel, and undo; proves Native two-, three-, and four-edge construction, all
  three styles, explicit reversals, transformed and Body-backed exact History
  sources, initially hidden input preservation, schema/missing/non-edge/
  duplicate/inactive-History no-ops, stale-preflight rejection, forced verifier
  rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute, and durable links, controls,
  identities, shapes, and visibility across FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_GEOMETRIC_FILL_GUI_OK`.
- The Surface Sections slice maps only the shipped `Surface_Sections` action
  to the `sections` variant of the focused `model.surface` family. Its compact,
  closed contract accepts two to 256 ordered, distinct exact current-History
  Part edges and the visible label; it exposes no Part Loft options because the
  retained human feature is specifically `Surface::Sections`. The 213-line
  implementation validates and freezes every exact edge before mutation,
  rejects duplicate resolved History states, creates the retained native
  feature with its exact ordered `NSections`, preserves all source
  presentations, publishes one root Design definition, and verifies every
  link, output Face, timeline role, Design identity, and unchanged input again
  before commit. Its concise result reports only root identity, section and
  output-edge counts, and surface area. The 641-line dispatcher-backed real GUI
  gate exercises the actual human automatic add-edge mode, edge removal,
  re-addition, drag-order model update, accept, cancel, and undo; proves Native
  two- and four-section construction, reverse ordering, transformed and
  Body-backed exact History sources, initially hidden input preservation,
  schema/missing/non-edge/duplicate/inactive-History no-ops, stale-preflight
  rejection, forced verifier rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute, and
  durable links, identities, shapes, and visibility across FCStd save/reopen.
  It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_SECTIONS_GUI_OK`.
- The Extend Face slice maps only the shipped `Surface_ExtendFace` action to
  the `extend` variant of the focused `model.surface` family. Its compact,
  closed contract accepts one exact current-History Part face, the visible
  label, independent U/V negative and positive parametric extensions, explicit
  symmetry flags, tolerance, and a bounded 2–512 sample grid. Omitted controls
  reproduce the human feature defaults exactly: 0.05 extension on all sides,
  both axes symmetric, 0.1 tolerance, and a 32-by-32 grid. The runtime requires
  equal paired values when an axis is symmetric. The 294-line implementation
  freezes the exact face before mutation, creates the retained native
  `Surface::Extend`, assigns controls without transient symmetry coupling,
  preserves the source presentation, publishes one root Design definition,
  and verifies the exact `Face` link, every durable control, output Face,
  timeline role, Design identity, and unchanged source again before commit.
  Its concise result reports root and source identities, face, U/V extension
  triples, sample grid, tolerance, and surface area. The audit also found and
  corrected a shipped persistence defect: XML restoration replayed asymmetric
  U/V values while default symmetry was still active, overwriting the first
  restored side. Symmetry coupling now remains active for live human edits but
  never rewrites serialized values during restore, and the shipped Surface
  persistence test proves an asymmetric range survives reopen exactly. The
  640-line dispatcher-backed real GUI gate exercises the immediate human exact
  one-face selection, native defaults, one-step undo/redo, and visibility;
  proves Native default and fully controlled asymmetric construction,
  transformed and Body-backed exact History sources, initially hidden input
  preservation, schema/missing/non-face/unequal-symmetry/inactive-History
  no-ops, stale-preflight rejection, forced verifier rollback, repeated
  recompute, exact undo/redo, and durable links, controls, identities, shapes,
  and visibility across FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_EXTEND_GUI_OK`.
- The Curve on Mesh slice maps only the shipped `Surface_CurveOnMesh` action
  to the `curve_on_mesh` variant of `model.surface`. Its compact closed
  contract takes one exact current-History `Mesh::Feature` and 2–64 ordered
  world-space pick rays, plus open/closed state, polyline or B-spline output,
  degree 1–8, C0–C3 continuity, fitting tolerance, and split angle. Omitted
  controls reproduce the effective human defaults exactly: open, approximated,
  degree 5, C2, 0.2 mm tolerance, and 45 degrees. The task panel's snap-pixel
  field is deliberately absent because the shipped handler does not consume
  it. The 441-line implementation resolves each forward ray to a source facet
  and barycentric weights, transforms each connection direction into source
  coordinates, fingerprints complete world-space mesh topology and segment
  membership, and creates the same recomputable `MeshPart::CurveOnMesh` object
  as the human task. It publishes one source-preserving History operation,
  retains every exact anchor and control, leaves source visibility unchanged,
  and verifies the complete native property contract and valid curve before
  commit. Its concise result reports root/source identities, anchor count,
  curve mode and controls, edge count, and length. Model state now includes a
  bounded mesh inventory with counts, visibility, and bounds so the provider
  can identify valid sources without changing ribbon or workbench. The
  829-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate drives the actual human task through
  viewport picks and its Create context action, measures only the resulting
  viewport quantization for parity, and proves Native open/default, fully
  controlled, closed, polyline, approximated, and hidden-source cases. It also
  proves missing/wrong/empty/future-History targets, misses, backward rays,
  duplicate anchors, complete-topology stale-preflight rejection, forced
  verifier rollback, exact undo/redo, repeated recompute, and durable source,
  anchor, direction, control, History, shape, and visibility state across FCStd
  save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_CURVE_ON_MESH_GUI_OK`.
- The Blend Curve slice maps only the shipped `Surface_BlendCurve` action to
  the immediate `blend_curve` variant of `model.surface`. Its compact closed
  contract takes two distinct exact current-History `EdgeN` references. Each
  endpoint independently carries a relative parameter from 0 to 1, C0 or
  G1–G4 continuity, and derivative size from -100 to 100; omitted controls
  reproduce the human feature defaults exactly at both ends: parameter 0,
  G2, and size 1. The 305-line implementation freezes both exact BREP edges
  before mutation, rejects a Body whose current tip changes after preflight,
  creates the same retained `Surface::FeatureBlendCurve` as the human command,
  and verifies both links, all six controls, the expected Bezier degree,
  valid output edge, unchanged sources, History role, and Design identity
  before commit. Its concise result reports the root, two exact endpoint
  contracts, degree, and length. The dispatcher-backed real GUI gate drives
  the actual two-edge human command and its actual edit task controls, then
  proves identical Native controlled geometry. It also covers defaults,
  C0–G4 combinations, negative derivative sizing, relative endpoint
  placement, transformed, Body-backed, and initially hidden sources,
  malformed/missing/non-edge/duplicate/future-History no-ops, complete BREP
  and Body-tip stale-preflight rejection, forced-verifier rollback,
  suppression, repeated recompute, exact undo/redo, and durable links,
  controls, identities, shapes, and visibility across FCStd save/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_SURFACE_BLEND_CURVE_GUI_OK`.
- The assistant-local undo ledger now proves the exact host undo-name stack at
  every checkpoint. It accepts normal stack growth or the exact oldest-entry
  eviction transition at FreeCAD's configured history limit, keeps only a
  contiguous assistant-owned sequence across structural revisions, and checks
  the exact expected prior stack after undo. Focused tests cover bounded
  history and intervening human transactions, and the full Split gate proves a
  valid assistant undo remains available after the default 20-entry limit is
  reached.
- The shared Design schema omits redundant `minLength` keywords where an
  existing anchored nonempty regex already enforces the same accepted
  language. The shared label provider schema retains its 160-character bound;
  every mutation runtime still rejects a blank label synchronously before
  document preflight or transaction. Exact patterns, closed objects, and all
  runtime validation remain in force. The fixed 64-KiB ceiling was not raised.
- The Design Extrude provider contract now represents its live one-sided,
  symmetric, and two-sided layouts as one ordered `sides` array. One-sided and
  symmetric operations require exactly one entry; two-sided operations require
  exactly two, with the runtime enforcing that kind-dependent count before
  document preflight. This removes three serialized copies of the same closed
  termination grammar, makes side order explicit, and reduced the complete
  Model schema by 1,970 bytes. Focused contracts and the full real Design
  profile lifecycle gate remain green; no compatibility-only Native path was
  retained.
- The existing Design primitive, reusable-profile, and standalone Part
  primitive provider contracts are
  compact closed field unions with explicit per-kind field maps instead of
  repeated schema branches. Variant prose remains in the internal capability
  registry while each provider tool lists its operation names once instead of
  repeating prose inside every branch. The visible call shapes and bounded
  fields are unchanged; the runtime rejects missing or unrelated primitive,
  Extrude-direction, Revolve-extent, Sweep-orientation, and Helix-mode fields
  before any document preflight or transaction. Both full Design lifecycle
  gates remain green, and the hard schema ceiling was not raised.
- Concise primitive/profile field descriptions removed another 900 serialized
  bytes without changing any schema field, bound, accepted value, runtime
  validation, or result contract. The hard schema ceiling remains unchanged.
- Schema canonicalization emits JSON integers for integral numeric bounds while
  retaining real numbers for non-integral bounds. This preserves JSON Schema
  number semantics and every accepted value while removing 614 redundant
  serialized decimal suffix bytes; a focused contract test proves the exact
  normalization. The Combine contract and shorter Boolean/Compound Filter
  descriptions make no runtime or result-contract changes.
- Multi-operation capability families now serialize as one closed object with
  an ordered operation enum, a concise exact top-level field map, and the
  deduplicated bounded union of their typed field schemas. A single-operation
  request retains its fully discriminated branch. The runtime continues to
  require the exact field set for the selected operation before preflight, so
  the compact provider form adds no permissive execution path. This reduced
  the then-complete registered Model schema from 65,519 to 56,742 bytes without
  changing any operation name, argument field, bound, target identity, result,
  or hard ceiling. Focused tests prove closed objects, common-required fields,
  conflicting typed field unions, field-map descriptions, and operation order.
  Real common, structure, Design primitive, reusable-profile, dress-up,
  transform, standalone Part, and Boolean GUI gates all pass through the
  compact multi-operation schemas.
- The Part Design VibeScript provider-source lifecycle fixture now models the
  production document-thread boundary instead of calling `Document` mutation
  directly from its background operation. A bounded deterministic test
  dispatcher queues publication back to the main test thread while preserving
  asynchronous create/edit/delete behavior. The full integration again emits
  structured `"ok": true`, including failed-source recovery, same-source edit,
  live publication, and deletion. All 39 current Model lifecycle gates, 761
  focused Native/authoring/ribbon tests and 356 broad VibeScript-facing
  surface/engine/timeline/portability tests are green. The complete Part Design
  VibeScript integration emits structured `"ok": true`, including failed-source
  recovery, same-source edit, and deletion. The complete registered Model
  schema set is 65,204 bytes, 332 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
  The complete Surface VibeScript native API integration also passes every
  explicit operation and its create/edit/save/reopen/delete lifecycle.
- Model standard-fastener insertion now uses a bounded `model.catalog`
  discovery tool and an exact-target `model.fastener` mutation tool over one
  shared human/Native fastener graph. The graph invokes the pinned 225-standard
  FreeCAD Fasteners generator at revision
  `033225ae84d65cfde0a39c2750dfa8e549a10cab`, creates a global
  `DesignGeneratedOperation` with stable source/result ownership, and performs
  targeted recompute without changing the existing human call default. The
  production verifier checks exact document identities and kernel geometry,
  while the concise receipt omits catalog and topology noise. Its GUI gate
  proves plain and modeled thread insertion, invalid-input no-ops, rollback,
  undo/redo, repeated recompute, and save/reopen; it emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_FASTENER_GUI_OK`. The exhaustive catalog gate covers
  all 225 standards, 3,580 nominal sizes, 5,355 resolved boundary/canonical
  keys, and 12 modeled-thread families; all 21 human Fasteners GUI tests pass.
  A new curved one-solid compound regression also found and fixed a core rigid
  placement conversion that previously altered mass properties by applying a
  general geometric transform. All 40 Design-modeling tests, the Hole lifecycle
  gate, 81 focused Native/catalog/registry tests, and the protected Part Design
  VibeScript lifecycle remain green. The complete registered Model schema is
  62,763 bytes, 2,773 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- Model standard-fastener editing is the second typed `model.fastener` variant
  and targets the published `PartDesign::Body` by exact internal name. The live
  Model snapshot now exposes every bounded editable fastener's Body, owning
  operation, part number, canonical key, and complete current constructor, so
  a later turn does not need the insertion transcript. Human and Native modern
  edits converge on one 599-line shared retained-graph implementation; legacy
  migration remains available only through the existing human command. Native
  preflight rejects stale, wrong-type, non-fastener, and incompatible-standard
  targets before opening a transaction, while the committed edit preserves the
  exact Body, publication, state, operation, and hidden generator identities.
  The upstream update helper's new targeted-recompute option is additive and
  defaults off, preserving all existing VibeScript and external call behavior.
  The expanded GUI gate proves human/Native geometry parity, exact receipts,
  wrong/stale/incompatible/schema no-ops, verifier rollback, undo/redo,
  repeated recompute, modeled threads, snapshot discovery, and save/reopen;
  it emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_FASTENER_GUI_OK`. All 21 human Fasteners GUI
  tests, 102 focused Native/catalog/snapshot/ribbon tests, the exhaustive
  225-standard catalog gate, and the complete Part Design VibeScript lifecycle
  are green. The complete registered Model schema is 63,150 bytes, 2,386 bytes
  below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- Model matching-fastener-hole creation is the third typed `model.fastener`
  variant and requires an exact retained fastener Body, one exact reusable
  Design-scope Sketch, a purpose and fit, and 1–16 explicit target Bodies. It
  resolves all catalog dimensions and rejects stale or wrong-type targets,
  Body-owned Sketches, the source fastener as a cut target, unsupported
  standards, and non-normal tapped fits before opening a transaction. The
  Native path creates the same global `PartDesign::DesignHole` history
  operation as the human command, shares the authoritative
  `resolve_fastener_hole` and `configure_fastener_hole_feature` algorithms,
  honors the user's current Hole-location preference, never opens a task
  panel, and returns only the operation, affected Bodies, derived fastener
  evidence, and exact receipt. Its dedicated GUI gate proves actual
  human/Native control, cutter, and Body-geometry parity; clearance, tapped
  multi-Body, counterbore, and countersink cases; schema/target/ownership/fit
  no-ops; forced verifier rollback; undo/redo; repeated recompute; and
  save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_MATCHING_FASTENER_HOLE_GUI_OK`. All 21 human Fasteners
  GUI tests, 811 focused Native/schema/ribbon/guardrail tests, the exhaustive
  225-standard catalog gate, and the complete Part Design VibeScript lifecycle
  are green. The complete registered Model schema is 64,015 bytes, 1,521 bytes
  below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit. New execution and gate modules are
  296 and 626 lines respectively.
- Model standard-fastener attachment is the fourth typed `model.fastener`
  variant and accepts one exact retained fastener Body plus one exact circular
  `EdgeN` on a retained Design-history Body. Provider preflight rejects stale,
  wrong-type, non-fastener, noncircular, self, already-attached, Assembly-link,
  and legacy Body-without-History targets before a transaction. Human GUI
  mapped-element tokens are canonicalized through their live host shape while
  the provider contract remains strictly `EdgeN`. Human and Native modern
  attachment share one 266-line retained-graph implementation that reorders
  the fastener History block after a later host operation, resolves the exact
  persistent Design subelement, and preserves the Body, publication, state,
  operation, and hidden generator identities. The production verifier proves
  the retained definition link, canonical edge, attachment center, aligned
  global placement, one valid solid, and local geometry agreement across the
  generator, operation output, state, publication, and Body before commit. Its
  609-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate drives the actual human ribbon command
  and Native tool, proves geometry/control parity without opening a dialog or
  changing workbench, and covers target no-ops, forced-verifier rollback,
  History ordering, exact receipts, undo/redo, repeated recompute, and durable
  save/reopen references. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_FASTENER_ATTACHMENT_GUI_OK`. All 21 human Fasteners GUI
  tests, 813 focused Native/schema/ribbon/packaging/guardrail tests, the
  exhaustive 225-standard catalog gate, and the complete Part Design
  VibeScript lifecycle are green. Source and build-tree packaged modules match;
  the complete registered Model schema is 64,370 bytes, 1,166 bytes below the
  unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- Model component-interface publication is now the exact-target
  `component.interface` capability over one explicitly named native component
  and one directly owned native LCS. Its closed schema requires the stable
  interface name, semantic kind, complete allowed-joint list, and explicit
  compatibility token; it is mapped only to the shared Publish Interface
  action on Model and Assemble and exposes no selection, command-dispatch, or
  workbench control. Preflight rejects stale or wrong-type targets, unowned
  LCS objects, duplicate names, VibeScript-owned components, malformed
  semantics, and identical publications before mutation. Human and Native
  paths retain one shared reference-contract algorithm, while Native adds
  frozen LCS-property state, exact re-resolution, one changed-LCS receipt,
  targeted recompute, and a postcondition that proves the persisted connector
  and placement frame before commit. The Model snapshot now lists bounded
  component-owned LCS objects and their published definitions so a later turn
  can continue without transcript memory. The retired
  `component.publish_interface` provider wrapper, registration, VibeScript
  surface leak, inventory entry, and old prompt instruction are deleted with
  no compatibility alias. The 609-line dispatcher-backed GUI gate drives the
  actual human ribbon dialog and Native tool, caught and fixed the human
  command's false-vs-None active-dialog predicate, and proves human/Native
  connector and frame parity, schema and target no-ops, stale preflight,
  forced-verifier rollback, exact receipt, update-in-place, undo/redo,
  repeated recompute, live snapshot/catalog discovery, and FCStd save/reopen.
  It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_COMPONENT_INTERFACE_GUI_OK`. The focused Native,
  schema, ribbon, surface, and retained-tool suite is 841/841 green; the full
  Part Design and Assembly VibeScript integration gates also complete
  successfully. Source and build-tree modules match, the retired name is
  absent from both trees, and the complete registered Model schema is 65,527
  bytes, 9 bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- Model-to-Sketch isolation and dropdown coverage are now enforced against the
  live action graph. The static inventories prove that Model and Sketch edit
  share only Fit All, Isometric, and Grid; all other 102 contextual Sketch
  actions are disjoint, and an injected Sketch geometry action makes Model
  classification fail closed. The production provider resolves the real
  75-action Model page while exposing only `sketch.validate` from any
  `sketch.*` family; after the human enters Sketch edit, Native is unavailable
  with no tools, and returning to Model restores the identical tool schemas.
  Model's only three live composite parents are Design Primitive, Offset, and
  Join. Production classification now requires their exact ordered sets of
  nine, two, and three leaves respectively, while the parents remain
  non-provider menu nodes and every leaf retains its exact capability and
  operation mapping. Focused tests reject missing, reordered, or displaced
  leaves, and the clean-profile GUI gate proves the same graph before and
  after a real Sketch edit transition. That gate also caught and corrected
  three live-contract drifts without compatibility aliases: view actions use
  presentation transactions, Matching Fastener Hole uses its complete live
  operation name, and Geometric Fill/Extend Face use their complete live
  operation names. The focused Native/ribbon/surface/guardrail suite is
  818/818 green, and the current registered Model schema is 65,530 bytes, 6
  bytes below the unchanged 64-KiB hard limit.
- The complete Model bracket workflow now runs through the real 75-action
  provider surface and production Native session factory. A 375-line
  clean-profile GUI gate creates one physical Component and two reusable
  Sketch definitions without entering edit mode, then drives the human into
  contextual Sketch edit to draw the closed base profile and mounting-hole
  profile. Each human ribbon transition makes the old Model turn fail with
  `NATIVE_SURFACE_CHANGED` both during edit and after returning; only a newly
  frozen Model turn can continue. The resumed workflow validates both
  profiles, extrudes a 60-by-30-by-8-mm component-owned Body, cuts one exact
  6-mm through-hole, and linearly patterns that subtractive feature into three
  holes at 20-mm spacing. It verifies exact removed volume, operation order
  and source identity, one-step pattern undo/redo, concise dispatcher results,
  no residual edit/task UI, stable Body and operation IDs, Component
  containment, recompute, and FCStd save/reopen. The gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MODEL_BRACKET_WORKFLOW_GUI_OK` on two consecutive runs. The
  live ribbon gate, 818 focused Native/ribbon/surface/guardrail tests, and the
  full Part Design VibeScript lifecycle are green; the protected VibeScript
  result reports `"ok": true`. Source and packaged build-tree copies match,
  and the complete registered Model schema remains 65,530 bytes, 6 bytes under
  the unchanged hard limit.
- Contextual Sketch now has an exact bounded state read for the one sketch the
  human actually opened. The 733-line domain serializer reports native
  geometry indices and persistent IDs where available, typed curve parameters,
  construction/internal state, constraint slots and values, exact projected
  source objects and subelements, native external-geometry indices, attachment
  support and offset, compact native wire/face diagnostics, DoF, and bounded
  conflict/redundancy/malformed/open-vertex state. Sketch setup keeps its
  document list summary-only; detailed state is never multiplied across every
  sketch. Large state prunes explicit tail records under a 52-KiB domain budget
  while preserving exact totals and truncation flags inside the unchanged
  64-KiB host snapshot limit. The read path never calls `solve()`, opens a
  transaction, changes geometry, or changes the human-selected surface. A
  293-line clean-profile GUI gate proves a real six-geometry, ten-constraint,
  externally projected, face-attached sketch; repeated read-only equality;
  unchanged undo/redo/booked-transaction boundaries; incomplete Sketch
  provider fail-closure; and FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_STATE_GUI_OK`. The focused suite is 821/821 green,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate is green, and the complete protected Part
  Design VibeScript lifecycle again reports `"ok": true`.
- Contextual Sketch Point is the first exact `sketch.geometry` mutation. Its
  890-byte closed schema requires the internal name of the sketch, the geometry
  and constraint counts observed in current state, and one bounded 2D
  position. Preflight and postcondition both prove that this is the exact
  `Sketcher::SketchObject` the human already has open on `sketch.edit`; the
  production path contains no workbench, ribbon, edit-session, selection, or
  `runCommand` activation. One host-owned transaction appends one
  non-construction `Part::GeomPoint`, recomputes only that sketch, preserves
  every pre-existing geometry and constraint definition, returns the exact new
  geometry plus compact profile/solver state, records only the changed sketch,
  and fails closed on stale counts or target drift. The complete Sketch surface
  remains unavailable and publishes zero schemas while the rest of its live
  actions are unfinished. A 326-line real-GUI gate proves wrong-target and
  stale-state refusal without history change, exact Point creation, one undo
  entry, duplicate-call idempotency, forced-verifier rollback, undo/redo while
  the same Sketch stays open, unchanged ribbon/workbench identity, and FCStd
  save/reopen. That gate has now become the rolling contextual-geometry gate
  described below so subsequent geometry variants reuse the same real GUI
  lifecycle instead of accumulating duplicate harnesses.
- Contextual Sketch Line is the second exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only `Sketcher_CreateLine`; the interactive Line/Polyline dropdown remains a
  parent-only action. The closed contract
  requires two bounded 2D endpoints and refuses coincident or sub-nanometre
  segments before a transaction. The 151-line domain module appends one
  non-construction `Part::GeomLineSegment` using the same exact active-Sketch,
  stale-count, full pre-existing geometry/constraint fingerprint, atomic
  transaction, targeted recompute, and concise solver/profile result contract
  as Point. Exact endpoint, type, index, construction state, receipt, undo, and
  persistence postconditions are independently checked. Point and Line together
  serialize to 1,546 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit, while
  the incomplete production Sketch surface still advertises zero tools and
  schemas. The rolling real-GUI geometry gate proves schema-valid but
  degenerate Line refusal without history change, Point rollback/idempotency,
  exact Line creation, separate one-step Point and Line undo/redo while the
  human-opened Sketch remains in edit, unchanged ribbon/workbench identity, and
  both geometries after FCStd save/reopen. Polyline extends that same gate below
  rather than duplicating its lifecycle harness.
- Contextual Sketch Polyline is the third exact `sketch.geometry` variant and
  maps only `Sketcher_CreatePolyline`. Its closed contract accepts 2 through 65
  bounded vertices plus an explicit open/closed choice, rejects consecutive
  duplicate or sub-nanometre vertices, requires at least three vertices when
  closed, and refuses an implicitly closed open path. The 257-line domain module
  atomically appends the exact ordered `Part::GeomLineSegment` sequence and
  explicit `Coincident` constraints at every joint, including the closing joint
  for a closed path. Postcondition proves every new segment endpoint, constraint
  reference, contiguous index, construction flag, full pre-existing fingerprint,
  receipt, and compact solver/profile result before commit. Point, Line, and
  Polyline together serialize to 1,969 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte
  hard limit, while the incomplete production Sketch surface still advertises
  zero tools and schemas. The rolling real-GUI gate proves invalid
  Polyline refusal without history mutation, exact open-path geometry and
  constraints, one-step atomic undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/
  workbench identity, and Point, Line, and Polyline persistence after FCStd
  save/reopen. Center-radius Arc extends that same gate below.
- Contextual Sketch center-radius Arc is the fourth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateArc`; the distinct
  `Sketcher_Create3PointArc` command remains unfinished. Its canonical closed
  contract requires a bounded 2D center, radius greater than one nanometre, a
  start angle from 0 inclusive to 360 degrees exclusive, and a counter-clockwise
  sweep strictly between 0 and 360 degrees. The 182-line domain module appends
  one non-construction `Part::GeomArcOfCircle` in one host transaction. Its
  postcondition proves exact center, +Z sketch-plane axis, radius, parameter
  range, analytic endpoints, open-curve state, index, construction state, full
  pre-existing geometry/constraint fingerprints, receipt, and compact solver/
  profile result before commit. Point, Line, Polyline, and Arc together serialize
  to 2,564 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit, while the
  incomplete production Sketch surface still advertises zero tools and schemas.
  The rolling real-GUI gate proves invalid-radius refusal without
  history mutation, exact Arc creation, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active
  Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all four geometry variants after FCStd
  save/reopen. Three-point Arc extends that same gate below.
- Contextual Sketch three-point Arc is the fifth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_Create3PointArc`. Its closed contract names
  two bounded endpoints and one bounded rim point. The 269-line domain module
  rejects every coincident pair, collinear or sub-nanometre-height triples, and
  circumcircles whose center or radius falls outside the one-million-mm Sketch
  bound before mutation. It analytically derives the circumcenter and chooses
  the direct or angular-seam-wrapped parameter interval whose interior contains
  the rim point. The shared 65-line circular-arc proof verifies the actual
  `Part::GeomArcOfCircle` center, +Z axis, radius, parameters, stored endpoint
  order, construction/open state, and analytic rim incidence before commit.
  Point, Line, Polyline, center Arc, and three-point Arc together serialize to
  3,388 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; the incomplete
  production Sketch surface still advertises zero tools and schemas. The
  rolling real-GUI gate uses the harder wrapped lower semicircle and
  proves collinear refusal without history mutation, exact creation, one-step
  undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all five
  variants after FCStd save/reopen. Elliptical Arc extends that same gate below.
- Contextual Sketch elliptical Arc is the sixth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateArcOfEllipse`. Its canonical closed contract
  requires a bounded center, distinct positive major/minor radii, bounded major
  axis rotation, start parameter, and counter-clockwise parameter sweep. The
  371-line domain module rejects circular or inverted radii and atomically
  creates the trimmed `Part::GeomArcOfEllipse` plus the exact durable state made
  by the human command: construction major/minor diameters, both construction
  foci, and four `InternalAlignment` constraints. Postcondition proves the main
  curve's center, +Z plane, rotated major axis, radii, parameter range and
  analytic endpoints; every internal role, coordinate and construction flag;
  every alignment reference; full pre-existing fingerprints; and concise
  receipt/solver/profile state before commit. The six geometry operations
  serialize to 4,011 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit, while
  incomplete production Sketch still advertises zero tools and schemas. The
  The rolling real-GUI gate proves equal-radius refusal without history
  mutation, the exact five-geometry/four-constraint delta, one-step undo/redo,
  unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all durable geometry
  after FCStd save/reopen. Stable provider and argument fixtures live in a
  separate support module so the executable lifecycle gate remains below the
  1,000-line split boundary. Hyperbolic Arc extends that gate below.
- Contextual Sketch hyperbolic Arc is the seventh exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateArcOfHyperbola`. Its closed contract
  requires a bounded center, positive major and minor coefficients, bounded
  major-axis rotation, and ordered dimensionless start/end parameters in the
  interval from -20 through 20. It deliberately permits a major coefficient
  below the minor coefficient, rejects equal or reversed parameter bounds, and
  analytically refuses endpoints outside the one-million-mm Sketch bound before
  mutation. The 359-line domain module creates one trimmed
  `Part::GeomArcOfHyperbola`, exposes the exact durable state created by the
  human command, and proves the three construction internals
  (`HyperbolaMajor`, `HyperbolaMinor`, and `HyperbolaFocus`) plus their three
  `InternalAlignment` constraints. Its postcondition also proves the main
  curve's center, +Z plane, rotated major axis, coefficients, parameter range,
  analytic endpoints, open/non-construction state, full pre-existing
  fingerprints, targeted receipt, and concise solver/profile state before
  commit. Elliptical and hyperbolic Arc share a 106-line internal-geometry
  verifier rather than duplicating role, coordinate, construction, and
  constraint-reference checks. The seven geometry operations serialize to
  exactly 4,357 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete
  production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas. The
  rolling real-GUI gate proves ordered-parameter refusal without history
  mutation, the exact four-geometry/three-constraint hyperbola delta, one-step
  undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all seven
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. Parabolic Arc extends that gate below.
- Contextual Sketch parabolic Arc is the eighth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateArcOfParabola`. Its closed contract uses a
  bounded vertex, positive focal length, bounded focal-axis rotation, and
  ordered start/end parameters expressed explicitly in millimetres. It rejects
  coincident, reversed, or sub-nanometre parameter spans and analytically
  refuses a focus or endpoint outside the one-million-mm Sketch bound before a
  transaction. The 336-line domain module constructs the exact
  `Part::GeomArcOfParabola`, exposes the durable state created by the human
  command, and proves the construction `ParabolaFocus` point, construction
  `ParabolaFocalAxis` line from vertex to focus, and both
  `InternalAlignment` references. Its main-curve postcondition proves the
  vertex, +Z plane, rotated focal axis, focal length, parameter range, analytic
  endpoints, open/non-construction state, full pre-existing fingerprints,
  targeted receipt, and concise solver/profile state before commit. The eight
  geometry operations serialize to exactly 5,004 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch still advertises zero
  tools and schemas. The 959-line executable real-GUI gate, backed by a
  separate 196-line provider/argument fixture, proves invalid-span refusal
  without history mutation, the exact three-geometry/two-constraint parabola
  delta, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity,
  and all eight operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola`.
  The focused suite is 932/932 green, the Sketch state and 527-action live
  ribbon gates remain green, the full protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle
  emits `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part
  Design phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code
  zero.
- Contextual Sketch center-radius Circle is the ninth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateCircle`; the dropdown parent and
  three-point Circle remain unimplemented. Its closed contract requires one
  bounded center and a radius greater than one nanometre. The 130-line domain
  module appends one non-construction `Part::GeomCircle` and reuses the shared
  88-line circular proof to verify the exact center, +Z Sketch-plane axis,
  radius, closed state, index, pre-existing fingerprints, targeted receipt,
  and concise solver/profile result before commit. The nine geometry
  operations serialize to exactly 5,127 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch still advertises zero
  tools and schemas. Circle's 86-line lifecycle case is separate from the
  974-line rolling GUI executable and 214-line provider/argument fixture, so
  every executable test module remains below the 1,000-line split boundary.
  The real host gate proves invalid-radius refusal without history mutation,
  exact creation, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench
  identity, and all nine operations after FCStd save/reopen. Reload validation
  deliberately compares the durable Circle contract rather than FreeCAD's
  document-local numeric geometry ID. The gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle`.
  The focused suite is 938/938 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch three-point Circle is the tenth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_Create3PointCircle`. Its closed contract
  names three bounded points and refuses every duplicate pair, collinear or
  sub-nanometre-height triple, and any derived center or radius outside the
  one-million-mm Sketch bound before mutation. The 159-line domain module
  constructs one exact non-construction `Part::GeomCircle`, proves its center,
  +Z axis, radius, closed state, and analytic incidence of all three requested
  points, then returns the same concise state/receipt contract as center-radius
  Circle. Three-point Arc and Circle now share a 70-line bounded circumcircle
  derivation; the Arc module is 225 lines after removing its duplicate math,
  and its established behavior and diagnostics remain covered. The ten
  geometry operations serialize to exactly 5,952 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise
  zero tools and schemas. Both Circle variants use the 143-line lifecycle case
  beside the 986-line rolling executable and 232-line provider fixture. The
  real host gate proves collinear refusal without history mutation, exact
  three-point Circle creation, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/
  ribbon/workbench identity, and all ten operations after FCStd save/reopen.
  It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle`.
  The focused suite is 944/944 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch center-based Ellipse is the eleventh exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateEllipseByCenter`;
  three-point Ellipse remains a separate action. Its closed contract
  requires a bounded center, distinct positive major/minor radii with the minor
  radius strictly smaller, and a bounded major-axis rotation. The 218-line
  domain module creates one closed non-construction `Part::GeomEllipse`, then
  exposes and proves the exact durable state made by the human command:
  construction major/minor diameter lines, both construction foci, and four
  `InternalAlignment` constraints. Full Ellipse and elliptical Arc now share a
  138-line analytic/internal-geometry layer; the Arc module is 291 lines after
  removing its duplicated axis, focus, endpoint, and record verification.
  Existing elliptical Arc tests remain green. The eleven geometry operations
  serialize to exactly 6,117 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard
  limit; incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and
  schemas. A 127-line Ellipse lifecycle case keeps the rolling executable at
  985 lines, with provider/argument fixtures at 278 lines. The real host gate
  proves equal-radius refusal without history mutation, the exact five-
  geometry/four-constraint delta, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/
  ribbon/workbench identity, and all eleven operations after FCStd save/reopen.
  It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse`.
  The focused suite is 953/953 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch three-point Ellipse is the twelfth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateEllipseBy3Points`.
  Its contract follows the human command precisely: the first two points are
  opposite endpoints of an initial axis and the third point lies on the
  ellipse. The 297-line domain module derives the midpoint and second radius,
  promotes the derived axis when it is longer, and refuses duplicate axis
  endpoints, an axis-collinear or out-of-span rim point, and the equal-radius
  Circle result before mutation. It creates and proves the closed full
  `Part::GeomEllipse`, both construction diameter lines, both construction
  foci, all four `InternalAlignment` constraints, and analytic incidence of
  all three source points. The twelve geometry operations serialize to exactly
  6,757 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete
  production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas. A 236-line
  Ellipse lifecycle case and 304-line provider/argument fixture keep the
  rolling executable at 997 lines, still below the 1,000-line split boundary.
  The real host gate proves invalid-rim refusal without history mutation, the
  exact five-geometry/four-constraint delta, one-step undo/redo, unchanged
  active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all twelve operations after
  FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse`.
  The focused suite is 961/961 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch corner Rectangle is the thirteenth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateRectangle`; the
  dropdown parent and center Rectangle remain unimplemented. Its closed
  contract names two bounded opposite corners and refuses a zero or
  sub-nanometre width or height before mutation. The 151-line corner domain
  uses a shared 173-line human-parity rectangle boundary for either diagonal
  direction: four counter-clockwise non-construction LineSegments, four
  explicit closing `Coincident` constraints, then four ordered
  `Horizontal`/`Vertical` constraints. Its postcondition proves every endpoint,
  corner reference, alignment reference and state flag, contiguous output
  index, full pre-existing fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/
  solver result before commit. The thirteen geometry operations serialize to
  exactly 7,345 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit;
  incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas,
  with center Rectangle now proving fail-closure. Before adding Rectangle, the
  997-line rolling lifecycle executable was split into a 274-line basic-
  geometry case and a 754-line orchestrator without changing its real-host
  assertions; after Rectangle the orchestrator is 768 lines and its new case
  is 118 lines. The real host gate proves zero-width refusal without history
  mutation, the exact four-geometry/eight-constraint delta for the negative-
  diagonal ordering, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/
  workbench identity, and all thirteen operations after FCStd save/reopen. It
  emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle`.
  The focused suite is 969/969 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch center Rectangle is the fourteenth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateRectangle_Center`;
  Oblong is now the next unfinished geometry action. Its closed contract names
  a bounded center and one bounded corner, rejects a zero or sub-nanometre half
  span, and refuses a reflected opposite corner outside the one-million-mm
  Sketch bound before mutation. The 231-line domain reuses the exact shared
  four-side/eight-constraint rectangle boundary, then appends the human
  command's construction `Part::GeomPoint` and three-reference `Symmetric`
  constraint between opposite corners and that center. Its postcondition
  proves the five geometries, all nine constraints and reference positions,
  construction/active/driving/virtual state, contiguous indices, full
  pre-existing fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/solver
  result before commit. The fourteen geometry operations serialize to exactly
  7,711 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete
  production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas, with
  Oblong proving fail-closure. The two Rectangle lifecycle cases share one
  216-line module beside the 781-line rolling orchestrator and 343-line
  provider/argument fixture. The real host gate proves zero-half-width refusal
  without history mutation, the exact five-geometry/nine-constraint delta,
  one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and
  all fourteen operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle`.
  The focused suite is 977/977 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, the protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch Oblong is the fifteenth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and
  maps only `Sketcher_CreateOblong`; Triangle is now the next unfinished
  geometry action. Its closed contract names two bounded opposite corners and
  a finite positive corner radius strictly smaller than half both spans, and
  refuses every invalid radius before mutation. The 486-line domain reuses the
  shared human-parity rectangle ordering to create four shortened
  non-construction LineSegments, four counter-clockwise quarter-circle arcs,
  and the human command's two construction corner Points. It applies and
  proves the exact nineteen-constraint topology: eight ordered `Tangent`, four
  `Horizontal`/`Vertical`, three `Equal`, and four `PointOnObject` constraints.
  The postcondition also proves canonical arc parameters, both diagonal
  orderings, construction/active/driving/virtual state, contiguous indices,
  the full pre-existing fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/
  solver result before commit. The fifteen geometry operations serialize to
  exactly 7,859 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit;
  incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas,
  with Triangle proving fail-closure. A 137-line Oblong lifecycle case keeps
  the rolling orchestrator at 795 lines and the provider/argument fixture at
  366 lines. The real host gate proves invalid-radius refusal without history
  mutation, the exact ten-geometry/nineteen-constraint delta, one-step undo/
  redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all fifteen
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong`.
  The focused suite is 985/985 green, the 527-action live ribbon gate remains
  green, source and built runtime copies are byte-identical, and the touched
  Python files pass Ruff. The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch Triangle is the sixteenth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateTriangle`; Square is now the next unfinished
  geometry action. Its closed contract names a bounded center and first corner,
  requires a non-degenerate radius no greater than one million mm, and refuses
  any derived vertex outside the same Sketch coordinate bound before mutation.
  A 51-line Triangle adapter fixes the side count at three while a 371-line
  regular-polygon domain owns the exact reusable human-command semantics. It
  creates three counter-clockwise non-construction LineSegments followed by
  the construction circumcircle, then applies and proves the human command's
  exact eight constraints: three closing `Coincident`, two `Equal`, and three
  endpoint-to-circle `PointOnObject` constraints. Its postcondition proves
  every generated vertex, line endpoint, circumcircle field, construction/
  active/driving/virtual state, contiguous index, full pre-existing
  fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/solver result before
  commit. The sixteen geometry operations serialize to exactly 7,910 bytes
  against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch
  continues to advertise zero tools and schemas, with Square proving
  fail-closure. A 131-line regular-polygon lifecycle case keeps the rolling
  orchestrator at 809 lines and the provider/argument fixture at 384 lines.
  The real host gate proves coincident center/corner refusal without history
  mutation, the exact four-geometry/eight-constraint delta, one-step undo/
  redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all sixteen
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,117/1,117 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch Square is the seventeenth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateSquare`; Pentagon is now the next unfinished
  geometry action. Its closed center/corner contract and all derived-bound
  checks reuse the proven 371-line regular-polygon domain through a separate
  51-line fixed-four-side adapter. It creates four counter-clockwise
  non-construction LineSegments and the construction circumcircle, then
  applies and proves the human command's exact eleven constraints: four
  closing `Coincident`, three `Equal`, and four endpoint-to-circle
  `PointOnObject` constraints. The postcondition proves every generated
  vertex, line endpoint, circumcircle field, durable state flag, contiguous
  index, pre-existing fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/
  solver result before commit. The seventeen geometry operations serialize
  to exactly 7,955 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit;
  incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and
  schemas, with Pentagon proving fail-closure. The shared regular-polygon GUI
  case is 237 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 821 lines, and its provider/
  argument fixture is 402 lines. The real host gate proves coincident center/
  corner refusal without history mutation, the exact five-geometry/eleven-
  constraint delta, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/

- Contextual Sketch Pentagon is the eighteenth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreatePentagon`; Hexagon is now the next
  unfinished geometry action. Its 51-line fixed-five-side adapter reuses the
  unchanged 371-line regular-polygon domain and its closed, derived-bounded
  center/corner contract. It creates five counter-clockwise non-construction
  LineSegments and the construction circumcircle, then applies and proves the
  human command's exact fourteen constraints: five closing `Coincident`, four
  `Equal`, and five endpoint-to-circle `PointOnObject` constraints. The
  postcondition proves the complete analytic shape, durable state, indices,
  pre-existing fingerprint, targeted receipt, and concise profile/solver
  result before commit. The eighteen geometry operations serialize to exactly
  8,006 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete
  production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas, with
  Hexagon proving fail-closure. The shared regular-polygon GUI case is 339

  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateHexagon`; Heptagon is now the next unfinished
  geometry action. Its 51-line fixed-six-side adapter reuses the unchanged
  371-line regular-polygon domain. It creates six counter-clockwise
  non-construction LineSegments and the construction circumcircle, then
  applies and proves six closing `Coincident`, five `Equal`, and six
  endpoint-to-circle `PointOnObject` constraints—the exact seventeen-
  constraint durable topology produced by the human command. All analytic,

- Contextual Sketch Heptagon is the twentieth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateHeptagon`; Octagon is now the next unfinished
  geometry action. Its 51-line fixed-seven-side adapter reuses the unchanged
  371-line regular-polygon domain and creates seven counter-clockwise
  non-construction LineSegments plus the construction circumcircle. It
  applies and proves the human command's exact twenty constraints: seven
  closing `Coincident`, six `Equal`, and seven endpoint-to-circle
  `PointOnObject` constraints, together with all analytic, durable-state,
  index, fingerprint, targeting, transaction, profile, and solver
  postconditions. The twenty geometry operations serialize to exactly 8,105

- Contextual Sketch Octagon is the twenty-first exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateOctagon`; arbitrary Regular Polygon is
  now the next unfinished geometry action. Its 51-line fixed-eight-side
  adapter reuses the unchanged 371-line regular-polygon domain. It creates
  eight counter-clockwise non-construction LineSegments and the construction
  circumcircle, then applies and proves the human command's exact twenty-three
  constraints: eight closing `Coincident`, seven `Equal`, and eight
  endpoint-to-circle `PointOnObject` constraints. All analytic, durable-state,
  index, fingerprint, targeting, transaction, profile, and solver
  postconditions remain closed. The twenty-one geometry operations serialize
  to exactly 8,153 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit;
  incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas,
  with arbitrary Regular Polygon proving fail-closure. The shared regular-
  polygon GUI case is 637 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 870 lines, and
  its provider/argument fixture is 486 lines. The real host gate proves
  coincident center/corner refusal without history mutation, the exact nine-
  geometry/twenty-three-constraint delta, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/
  workbench identity, and all twenty-one operations after FCStd save/reopen.
  This twenty-first successful transaction also reaches FreeCAD's default
  twenty-entry undo retention limit; the gate proves the new named Octagon
  transaction replaces only the oldest retained entry and still undoes and
  redoes as one coherent step. It emits

  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch arbitrary Regular Polygon is the twenty-second exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateRegularPolygon`;
  straight Slot is now the next unfinished geometry action. Its 65-line
  adapter exposes the human dialog's integer side-count control and strictly
  bounds it from 3 through 9,999, rejecting booleans, fractional counts, and
  out-of-range values before mutation. It reuses the unchanged 371-line
  regular-polygon domain for exact topology. A proved nine-sided call creates
  nine counter-clockwise non-construction LineSegments and the construction
  circumcircle, with nine closing `Coincident`, eight `Equal`, and nine
  endpoint-to-circle `PointOnObject` constraints. The same closed analytic,
  durable-state, index, fingerprint, targeting, transaction, profile, and
  solver postconditions scale from the requested side count. The twenty-two
  geometry operations serialize to exactly 8,373 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise
  zero tools and schemas, with straight Slot proving fail-closure. The shared
  regular-polygon GUI case is 742 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 883
  lines, and its provider/argument fixture is 507 lines. The real host gate
  proves invalid side-count refusal without history mutation, the exact ten-
  geometry/twenty-six-constraint nine-sided delta, retention of the newest
  named transaction at the twenty-entry undo limit, one-step undo/redo,
  unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all twenty-two
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,144/1,144 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch straight Slot is the twenty-third exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateSlot`; arc Slot is now the next
  unfinished geometry action. Its 359-line domain follows
  `DrawSketchHandlerSlot` exactly: two non-construction semicircular arcs in
  human-command order, two connecting LineSegments, four endpoint-specific
  `Tangent` constraints, and one arc `Equal` constraint. The strict contract
  accepts the two arc centers and radius, refuses coincident centers,
  non-positive radii, unexpected fields, stale target counts, and any derived
  boundary outside the fixed coordinate envelope before mutation. It proves
  exact geometry and constraint indices, parameters, centers, endpoints,
  topology, fingerprints, active-Sketch identity, and the four-geometry/five-
  constraint append in one document transaction. The twenty-three geometry
  operations serialize to exactly 8,946 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-
  byte hard limit; incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero
  tools and schemas, with arc Slot proving fail-closure. The dedicated GUI
  case is 145 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 897 lines, and its provider/
  argument fixture is 527 lines, keeping each module below the split boundary.
  The real host gate proves schema-level invalid-radius refusal without
  history mutation, the exact durable topology, retention of the newest named
  transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, one-step undo/redo,
  unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all twenty-three
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,151/1,151 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch Arc Slot is the twenty-fourth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateArcSlot`; non-periodic B-spline is now
  the next unfinished geometry action. Its 458-line domain follows the shipped
  action's default rounded-end `DrawSketchHandlerArcSlot` construction for
  both positive and negative sweeps. It preserves the human geometry order:
  outer boundary, initial semicircular end, terminal semicircular end, and—
  when the slot radius is smaller than the centerline radius—inner boundary.
  It applies and proves the handler's exact center `Coincident` and four
  direction-specific `Tangent` constraints. The valid human boundary case in
  which slot radius equals centerline radius is separately proved as three
  arcs, two `Coincident` constraints, and two `Tangent` constraints. The
  strict contract refuses zero/full-turn sweeps, an oversized slot radius,
  the Open CASCADE inner-boundary confusion interval, stale target counts,
  unexpected fields, and an unbounded outer envelope before mutation. Exact
  arc roles, canonical parameters, centers, endpoints, radii, direction,
  geometry/constraint indices, fingerprints, and one-transaction append
  counts are postconditions. The twenty-four geometry operations serialize
  to exactly 9,444 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit;
  incomplete production Sketch continues to advertise zero tools and schemas,
  with non-periodic B-spline proving fail-closure. The combined Slot GUI case
  is 283 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 909 lines, and its provider/
  argument fixture is 551 lines. The real host gate proves an invalid radius
  fails without history mutation, a clockwise four-arc/five-constraint call
  retains its newest named transaction at the twenty-entry undo limit, exact
  one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and
  all twenty-four operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,161/1,161 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual non-periodic control-point B-spline is the twenty-fifth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreateBSpline`; periodic
  B-spline is now the next unfinished geometry action and continues to keep
  production Sketch fail-closed. The 523-line shared control-point B-spline
  core and 63-line non-periodic adapter reproduce the shipped human handler's
  durable construction in its exact order: one construction circle per pole,
  one `Weight` constraint followed by `Equal` constraints, the non-construction
  spline, one `InternalAlignment:BSplineControlPoint` constraint per pole, and
  the exposed construction knot points with their
  `InternalAlignment:BSplineKnotPoint` constraints. The contract accepts two
  through twenty-four exact control points and a requested degree from one
  through twenty-five, clamps the effective degree to the human tool's
  non-periodic limit, generates the exact uniform knots and clamped endpoint
  multiplicities, and refuses adjacent duplicate poles, malformed fields,
  invalid degrees, stale target counts, and out-of-bounds coordinates before
  mutation. Postconditions prove every durable geometry and constraint index,
  role, pole, knot, multiplicity, weight, parameter, internal type, reference,
  append count, fingerprint, and active-Sketch identity. The twenty-five
  geometry operations serialize to exactly 9,904 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit. The dedicated B-spline GUI case is 184 lines, the
  rolling orchestrator is 923 lines, and its provider/argument fixture is 571
  lines. The real host gate proves duplicate-pole refusal without history
  mutation, the exact seven-geometry/ten-constraint durable append, retention
  of the newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit,
  one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and
  all twenty-five operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,171/1,171 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual periodic control-point B-spline is the twenty-sixth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only `Sketcher_CreatePeriodicBSpline`;
  interpolated B-spline is now the next unfinished geometry action and keeps
  production Sketch fail-closed. Its 63-line adapter reuses the now 537-line
  shared control-point core while preserving the human handler's periodic
  differences: two poles are sufficient, effective degree clamps to the pole
  count, the closing click does not add a duplicate terminal pole, every knot
  has multiplicity one, and all N+1 periodic knot points are exposed even
  though the first and terminal points coincide. The exact durable order
  remains construction pole circles with one `Weight` and subsequent `Equal`
  constraints, the non-construction periodic spline, control-point alignment
  constraints, then exposed knot points and knot-alignment constraints. The
  strict contract refuses an explicit final pole equal to the first because
  that is not a state the human handler creates, as well as adjacent duplicate
  poles, malformed fields, invalid degrees, stale counts, and out-of-bounds
  coordinates before mutation. Postconditions additionally prove periodic and
  closed state, equal curve endpoints, uniform knots, N+1 knot internals, and
  all exact defining data, indices, references, fingerprints, append counts,
  and active-Sketch identity. The twenty-six geometry operations serialize to
  exactly 9,982 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit. The
  combined B-spline GUI case is 356 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 936
  lines, and its provider/argument fixture is 590 lines. The real host gate
  proves duplicate-closure refusal without history mutation, the exact
  twelve-geometry/sixteen-constraint durable append, retention of the newest
  named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, one-step undo/redo,
  unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity, and all twenty-six
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,180/1,180 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual non-periodic interpolated B-spline is the twenty-seventh exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only
  `Sketcher_CreateBSplineByInterpolation`; periodic interpolated B-spline is
  now the next unfinished geometry action and keeps production Sketch
  fail-closed. Its 487-line domain follows the shipped handler's knot-based
  workflow rather than reusing control-point topology: it first appends the
  exact construction interpolation points, creates and degree-raises the
  Open CASCADE interpolation result to the handler's fixed cubic degree,
  aligns the input points as B-spline knots, and then calls Sketcher's internal
  exposure to create the generated construction control circles. The exposure
  constraints deliberately preserve their different human order—control
  `InternalAlignment` followed by `Weight` or reversed-reference `Equal` for
  each pole. The special three-input handler behavior is separately proved:
  the middle interpolation point is a `PointOnObject` rather than a generated
  knot, while the two endpoints remain knot alignments. The strict contract
  accepts two through twenty-four exact input points and refuses adjacent
  duplicates, malformed fields, stale target counts, and out-of-bounds
  coordinates before mutation. An independently reconstructed reference curve
  proves the exact generated poles, weights, knots, multiplicities, degree,
  parameters, endpoints, periodic/closed state, durable control handles,
  semantic weight radii, every constraint/index/reference, append counts,
  fingerprints, and active-Sketch identity. The twenty-seven geometry
  operations serialize to exactly 10,445 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit. The combined B-spline GUI case is 525 lines, the
  rolling orchestrator is 948 lines, and its provider/argument fixture is 608
  lines. The real host gate proves adjacent-duplicate refusal without history
  mutation, the exact eleven-geometry/sixteen-constraint durable append,
  retention of the newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo
  limit, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity,
  and all twenty-seven operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,186/1,186 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime
  copies are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual periodic interpolated B-spline is the twenty-eighth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only
  `Sketcher_CreatePeriodicBSplineByInterpolation`; Sketch text is now the next
  unfinished geometry action and production Sketch remains fail-closed. Its
  62-line adapter reuses the 606-line interpolation domain while preserving
  the shipped human handler's distinct periodic topology: two through
  twenty-four construction interpolation points, a periodic Open CASCADE
  interpolation raised to cubic degree, one knot alignment for every input,
  generated construction control circles, and exposure of the one terminal
  periodic knot not represented by an input handle. The strict contract
  refuses adjacent duplicates and an explicit final input equal to the first,
  because the human closing click adds neither duplicate geometry nor a second
  input constraint. Postconditions reconstruct an independent periodic
  reference curve and prove its exact poles, weights, knots, multiplicities,
  degree, closed endpoints, every generated internal handle, every constraint
  and reference, append counts, fingerprints, and active-Sketch identity. The
  two-point host special case is separately proved with six poles, three knots,
  and multiplicities `[3, 3, 3]`. The twenty-eight geometry operations
  serialize to exactly 10,574 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard
  limit. The combined B-spline GUI case is 715 lines, the rolling orchestrator
  is 966 lines, and its provider/argument fixture is 625 lines. The real host
  gate proves duplicate-closure refusal without history mutation, the exact
  eleven-geometry/fifteen-constraint durable append for four input points,
  retention of the newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo
  limit, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity,
  and all twenty-eight operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation`.
  The focused contract suite is 1,193/1,193 green with four intentional skips,
  the 527-action live ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime copies
  are byte-identical, and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The protected
  Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both with exit code zero.
- Contextual Sketch Text is the twenty-ninth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_CreateText`; at that checkpoint Construction-state
  changes remained the next unfinished Sketch action and production Sketch
  remained fail-closed.
  The shipped handler was traced through its C++ creation and persistence
  paths: it appends one construction handle line, generates the font outlines
  as non-construction Sketch curves, and owns the complete group through one
  `Text` constraint. The existing Python wrapper could only expose the first
  three references and none of the durable Text metadata, so it now adds four
  read-only properties—`Elements`, `Text`, `Font`, and `IsTextHeight`—without
  changing any existing API. The bounded 465-line domain accepts exact handle
  endpoints, width/height sizing, one through sixty-four visible single-line
  characters, and either the `default` sentinel or an installed font basename.
  Font discovery follows the same bundled and platform font roots as the human
  dialog, resolves a canonical name without exposing a machine path, and
  revalidates the selected file identity immediately before mutation. It caps
  generated glyph topology at 512 curves and returns only the handle, Text
  constraint summary, curve count/range, kind counts, and a SHA-256 geometry
  fingerprint instead of dumping every glyph edge. Postconditions prove the
  exact construction handle, contiguous generated curves, all constraint
  elements, text, persisted font basename, sizing mode, active/driving state,
  pre-existing fingerprints, append counts, and active-Sketch identity. The
  twenty-nine geometry operations serialize to exactly 11,336 bytes against
  the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit. The isolated Text GUI case is 168
  lines, the provider fixture is 649 lines, and the rolling orchestrator is
  883 lines after all save/reopen verification was moved behind a dedicated
  160-line boundary module before the next lifecycle case. The real host gate
  proves multiline refusal without history mutation,
  then creates `AI` with the bundled `osifont-lgpl3fe` as one handle plus 22
  exact glyph curves (13 B-splines and nine lines) owned by a 23-element Text
  constraint. It proves the newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry
  undo limit, one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench
  identity, the new read-only constraint properties, and all twenty-nine
  operations after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text`.
  The rebuilt Sketcher core and SteveCAD scripts are green, the focused contract
  suite is 1,208/1,208 green with four intentional skips, the 527-action live
  ribbon gate remains green, source and built runtime copies are byte-identical,
  and the touched Python files pass Ruff. The protected Sketcher VibeScript
  lifecycle emits `STEVECAD_SKETCHER_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases emit `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_OK_TRUE`, both
  with exit code zero.
- Sketch Construction is the thirtieth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and
  maps only `Sketcher_ToggleConstruction`; at that checkpoint,
  automatic/general Dimension was the next unfinished Sketch action and the
  production surface remained fail-closed there. The shipped handler was
  traced before implementation:
  without a selection it changes only the human's ephemeral creation mode,
  which Native does not expose; with a selection it durably toggles ordinary
  internal geometry, redirects grouped members through their group handle,
  refuses internal-alignment geometry, and uses the external geometry
  extension's `Defining` flag rather than the generic Construction bit.
  Standalone point geometry is supported, while a vertex selection on another
  curve is not misrepresented as a geometry target. The bounded 359-line
  domain therefore accepts only the active Sketch identity, exact internal,
  constraint, and external counts, and one through sixty-four distinct exact
  geometry indices with their expected current states. Its preflight freezes
  every internal geometry, constraint, and external-geometry record; it
  refuses stale states, axes, grouped members instead of their handle,
  internal-alignment geometry, missing external `Defining` support, count
  drift, duplicate targets, and any unrelated topology or metadata change.
  It calls the same `toggleConstruction` primitive as the human command and
  reports only the changed indices, state kinds, previous/current states,
  solver/profile summary, and transaction receipt. Active Sketch state now
  includes bounded exact external-geometry records and omits FreeCAD's noisy
  literal `InternalType == "None"`. The thirty-operation provider schema is
  exactly 11,917 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit. The real
  GUI case is 169 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 905 lines, and save/reopen
  verification remains isolated in its 164-line boundary module. The GUI gate
  proves stale-state, grouped-member, and internal-alignment refusal without
  history mutation; then it toggles an internal line's Construction state and
  an external edge's Defining state in one named transaction while preserving
  the human selection. It proves the twenty-entry undo cap, one-step undo/redo,
  exact concise response and receipt, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench,
  and both durable states plus all thirty operations after FCStd save/reopen.
  It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction`.
  Construction/schema/state tests are 49/49 green, and the full current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,561/1,561 green with four intentional skips. The
  rebuilt runtime passed the real GUI lifecycle, and the previously completed
  527-action live ribbon and protected Sketcher/Part Design VibeScript gates
  remain green.
- Sketch automatic/general Dimension is the first exact `sketch.constraint`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_Dimension`; at that checkpoint, horizontal
  Distance was the next unfinished Sketch action and the production surface
  remained fail-closed there. The shipped interactive command was traced
  before implementation.
  Its cursor location, selection shape, and mode cycling can select unrelated
  dimensional and geometric constraint families, so Native exposes only four
  deterministic outcomes: `distance_x`, `distance_y`, `distance`, and `angle`.
  It explicitly refuses diagonal single-line and two-point projection cases,
  radius-versus-diameter cases, non-dimensional mode cycling, more than two
  selected elements, unsupported conics and whole B-splines, and degenerate
  zero/coincident/tangent/collinear cases instead of guessing the human's
  cursor or preference state. The exact request names one or two geometry
  elements and their whole/start/end/center positions, the expected inferred
  kind, exact internal/constraint/external counts, an explicit driving state,
  and a unit-bearing dimension. Stale or surprising inference is rejected
  before mutation. Reference dimensions treat the supplied value as an
  expected current measurement and refuse measurement drift.
  The bounded 674-line domain uses the same point/curve constructor forms and
  line-angle endpoint orientation as the human command. It supports root axes
  only where their semantics are defined, refuses grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry and unavailable external geometry, preserves the
  human selection, and executes one named document transaction. Its
  postcondition freezes all pre-existing topology, metadata, external geometry
  and unrelated constraints while allowing the solver to move existing
  coordinates and update pre-existing reference measurements. It then proves
  the exact new constraint, requested driving state, solver health, counts,
  profile state, and concise transaction receipt. Exact-state helpers and
  target parsing and append proof are isolated in 124-, 328-, and 257-line
  modules shared with later constraints; the real GUI case is 222 lines,
  save/reopen remains behind a 170-line boundary, and the rolling orchestrator
  was split to 690 lines before adding the next lifecycle case. The current
  two-operation constraint schema is exactly 2,082 bytes; both Sketch
  tool-family schemas together are 13,998 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte hard limit.
  The GUI gate proves ambiguous-inference, stale-inference, and unit-mismatch
  refusal without history mutation; then it creates an exact driving
  horizontal distance, proves the solver changes a 10 mm line to 20 mm,
  preserves the human selection, reaches FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo cap,
  proves one-step undo/redo, and verifies all thirty geometry operations plus
  the inferred dimension after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension`.
  Dimension/schema tests are 34/34 green, and the full current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,595/1,595 green with four intentional skips. The
  rebuilt runtime passed the real GUI lifecycle, the 527-action live ribbon
  gate remains green, source and built runtime copies are byte-identical, and
  touched Python passes Ruff. The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and
  all 17 protected Part Design phases both complete with exit code zero; the
  Part Design result reports `"ok": true`.
- Sketch horizontal Distance is the second exact `sketch.constraint` variant
  and maps only `Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceX`; vertical Distance is now the
  next unfinished Sketch action and the production surface remains fail-closed
  there. The shipped human command was traced before implementation. Native
  preserves its three durable forms: one exact point receives a signed X
  coordinate relative to the origin, one whole line is converted to its two
  endpoints, and two exact points receive a positive horizontal separation
  after the same negative-sign endpoint normalization as the human command.
  Signed and zero point coordinates are valid. Zero two-point projection,
  axes selected as whole lines, the origin selected alone, unsupported whole
  curves, whole elements in a two-point request, duplicate targets, grouped
  members, internal-alignment geometry, missing external geometry, and stale
  counts or reference measurements are refused before mutation.
  The exact request names the active Sketch, internal/constraint/external
  counts, one or two whole/start/end/center elements, a millimetre value, and
  an explicit driving state. Reference mode requires the supplied value to
  match the current signed coordinate or normalized separation. Driving mode
  is never silently converted to reference mode. A 257-line shared constraint
  append module constructs the exact active/driving constraint and calls
  Sketcher's non-mutating `diagnoseAdditionalConstraints` before a document
  transaction opens. Conflicting, redundant, partially redundant, malformed,
  inconsistent, or unavailable feasibility results fail closed without an
  append. The feasibility call must preserve every geometry, constraint,
  external-geometry, and solver-diagnostic record. The 356-line operation
  domain then opens one named transaction, adds exactly one `DistanceX`, and
  proves the exact references, signed value, driving/active/virtual state,
  unchanged topology and metadata, stable unrelated constraints, solver
  health, and the measured solved result. Its concise response contains only
  operation, target form, exact constraint, before/after measurement, Sketch
  counts/profile summary, and receipt.
  Compact multi-operation provider schemas are now revalidated in the
  dispatcher against the selected variant's original closed schema before a
  ticket or runtime call is created. This preserves the 64-KiB surface cap
  without allowing a compact union to weaken operation-specific nested values
  or required fields. The constraint schema remains 2,082 bytes and both
  Sketch schemas remain 13,998 bytes. Constraint dispatch is 408 lines, the
  schema/runtime/binding files are 190/91/44 lines, the focused GUI case is 200
  lines, its ordered catalog helper is 95 lines, the rolling orchestrator is
  690 lines, and save/reopen is 170 lines.
  The real GUI gate refuses an axis target, an already constrained line through
  the solver-feasibility path, a stale reference measurement, and a wrong unit
  without history mutation. It then creates a point at X=-12 mm and applies an
  exact driving X coordinate of -30 mm while preserving the human selection.
  It proves the measured solver result, FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo cap,
  one-step undo/redo restoring both constraint and solved point position, exact
  receipt, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, final 173-geometry and
  244-constraint counts, and all prior operations plus horizontal Distance
  after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 75/75 green, and the full
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,626/1,626 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative completed Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon
  gate remain green. Source and built runtime copies are byte-identical,
  touched Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected
  Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design phases both
  complete with exit code zero; the Part Design result reports `"ok": true`.
- Sketch vertical Distance is the third exact `sketch.constraint` variant and
  maps only `Sketcher_ConstrainDistanceY`; general Distance is now the next
  unfinished Sketch action and the production surface remains fail-closed
  there. The shipped human command was traced before implementation. Native
  preserves its three durable forms: one exact point receives a signed Y
  coordinate relative to the origin, one whole line is converted to its two
  endpoints, and two exact points receive a positive vertical separation
  after negative-sign endpoint normalization. Signed and zero point
  coordinates are valid. Equal-Y two-point targets are refused with guidance
  to use a Horizontal geometric constraint. Axes selected as whole lines, the
  origin selected alone, unsupported whole curves, whole elements in a
  two-point request, non-positive two-point values, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable external geometry, stale counts,
  and stale reference measurements are all rejected before mutation.
  Reference mode requires the supplied signed coordinate or normalized
  separation to match the current measurement. Driving mode remains driving
  and is never silently converted to reference mode.
  Horizontal and vertical implementations now share one 413-line exact
  axis-distance core behind separate 63-line bindings. The definition accepts
  only the two internally consistent X/`DistanceX` and Y/`DistanceY`
  identities, and every preflight, creation, and verification boundary rejects
  cross-routed X/Y state. The shared core uses Sketcher's non-mutating solver
  feasibility diagnostic before opening a transaction, freezes every
  pre-existing geometry, constraint, external-geometry, and solver record,
  then adds and verifies exactly one active constraint with its exact
  references, value, driving state, solved measurement, and concise receipt.
  Constraint schema/runtime/binding files are 203/117/44 lines. The three
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 2,169 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus three constraint variants serialize together to exactly
  14,085 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit.
  The focused real-GUI case is 200 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 708
  lines, and save/reopen remains behind a 174-line boundary module. The gate
  refuses a whole-axis target, stale reference measurement, wrong unit, and a
  duplicate constraint without changing history. It then creates a point at
  Y=-14 mm, applies an exact driving Y coordinate of -35 mm, and proves the
  resulting `DistanceY`, measured solver result, preserved human selection,
  newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, exact receipt,
  one-step undo/redo, unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, final
  174-geometry and 245-constraint counts, and every prior operation plus
  vertical Distance after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 105/105 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,653/1,653 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative completed Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon
  gate remain green. All packaged touched source/build copies are
  byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean.
  The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases complete with exit code zero; the Part Design result reports
  `"ok": true`.
- Sketch general Distance is the fourth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and
  maps only `Sketcher_ConstrainDistance`; combined Radius/Diameter is now the
  next unfinished Sketch action and the production surface remains fail-closed
  there. The shipped command and its solver tests were traced before
  implementation. Native exposes all stable durable forms: signed
  horizontal-axis-to-point `DistanceY`, signed vertical-axis-to-point
  `DistanceX`, direct point-to-point `Distance`, whole-line length,
  whole-circular-arc length, point-to-line, point-to-circle or circular arc,
  circle or circular-arc to line, and circle or circular-arc to another circle
  or circular arc. Point/curve and circle/line selections are normalized to
  the exact constructor order used by Sketcher. Direct point distances and all
  non-axis lengths are positive; signed and zero axis coordinates remain
  valid.
  One point alone, one whole circle without a second curve, an axis length,
  two whole lines, unsupported whole curves, coincident points, zero-length
  lines, points already on curves, tangent curve pairs, stale counts, stale
  reference measurements, grouped members, internal-alignment geometry, and
  unavailable external geometry are refused before mutation. Sketcher's own
  solver suite marks negative driving circle/line secant distances as
  unsupported, so intersecting circle/line and circle/circle targets fail
  closed instead of silently converting intersection depth into a positive
  clearance and moving geometry to another branch. Explicit reference mode
  requires the supplied value to equal the current measurement; explicit
  driving mode is never silently converted to reference mode.
  The bounded 613-line domain freezes the exact active Sketch and all
  geometry, constraint, external-geometry, and solver records, constructs only
  the resolved Sketcher constraint form, calls the non-mutating solver
  feasibility diagnostic before a transaction opens, then proves the exact
  references, type, value, driving/active/virtual state, solved measurement,
  stable unrelated state, solver health, and concise receipt. Constraint
  schema/runtime/binding files are 216/143/44 lines. The four constraint
  variants serialize to exactly 2,248 bytes, and the thirty geometry plus four
  constraint variants serialize together to exactly 14,164 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit.
  The focused real-GUI case is 220 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 720
  lines, and save/reopen remains behind a 176-line boundary module. The gate
  refuses an incomplete point target, stale reference value, wrong unit, two
  whole lines, and a duplicate exact length without history mutation. It then
  creates an isolated 5 mm line and applies an exact driving 13 mm whole-line
  `Distance` while preserving the human selection. It proves the measured
  solver result, newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo
  limit, one-step undo/redo restoring the 5/13 mm states, exact receipt,
  unchanged active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, final 175-geometry and
  246-constraint counts, and every prior operation plus general Distance after
  FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 137/137 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,685/1,685 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the clean rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative completed Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon
  gate remain green. All packaged touched source/build copies are
  byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean.
  The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases complete with exit code zero; the Part Design result reports
  `"ok": true`.
- Sketch combined Radius/Diameter is the fifth exact `sketch.constraint`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_ConstrainRadiam`; explicit Radius is now the
  next unfinished Sketch action and the production surface remains fail-closed
  there. The shipped command was traced before implementation. For normal
  geometry it deterministically creates `Diameter` on a whole circle and
  `Radius` on a whole circular arc. Its human multi-selection convenience adds
  `Equal` constraints before one size constraint, while a B-spline control
  handle is actually a `Weight` target. Native keeps those semantics explicit:
  this operation accepts one exact whole normal curve and requires the caller
  to state the expected `radius` or `diameter` result. Multi-curve sizing is
  refused with guidance to use the separately scoped Equal operation, and
  B-spline-owned internal geometry remains unavailable here because pole
  Weight is its own shipped action at step 10.82.
  The exact request includes the active Sketch, internal/constraint/external
  counts, one whole geometry index, expected constraint kind, positive
  millimetre value, and explicit driving state. Exact target-kind mismatch,
  point or axis positions, lines, standalone points, ellipses, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable external geometry, stale counts,
  and stale reference values are rejected before mutation. Explicit reference
  mode requires the supplied diameter or radius to match the current
  measurement; explicit driving mode is never silently converted to reference
  mode.
  The bounded 320-line domain freezes every pre-existing geometry, constraint,
  external-geometry, and solver record, constructs exactly one `Diameter` or
  `Radius`, calls the non-mutating solver feasibility diagnostic before a
  transaction opens, then proves its exact reference, value,
  driving/active/virtual state, solved measurement, stable unrelated state,
  solver health, and concise receipt. Constraint schema/runtime/binding files
  are 287/170/44 lines. The five constraint variants serialize to exactly
  2,563 bytes, and the thirty geometry plus five constraint variants serialize
  together to exactly 14,479 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte hard
  limit.
  The focused real-GUI case is 229 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 732
  lines, and save/reopen remains behind a 178-line boundary module. The gate
  refuses an incorrect expected kind, stale reference value, wrong unit, line
  target, multi-target request, and duplicate exact constraint without history
  mutation. It then creates an isolated radius-5 mm circle and applies an exact
  driving 16 mm `Diameter`, proving the solved radius is 8 mm, preserving the
  human selection, reaching FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, and retaining
  exact receipt, one-step undo/redo, active Sketch/ribbon/workbench identity,
  final 176-geometry and 247-constraint counts, and every prior operation plus
  combined Radius/Diameter after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance,constrain_radius_diameter`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 164/164 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,712/1,712 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative completed Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon
  gate remain green. All packaged touched source/build copies are
  byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean.
  The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases complete with exit code zero; the Part Design result reports
  `"ok": true`.
- Sketch Radius is the sixth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only
  `Sketcher_ConstrainRadius`; explicit Diameter is the next unfinished Sketch
  action, so the production Sketch surface remains fail-closed there. The
  shipped Radius command was traced before implementation: it creates a
  `Radius` constraint for either a whole circle or whole circular arc, its
  multi-selection driving shortcut adds `Equal` constraints before one Radius,
  and a B-spline control handle is actually a `Weight` target. Native keeps
  those distinct operations explicit. This Radius operation accepts one exact
  whole normal circle or circular arc, requires Equal to be called separately
  for a size group, and leaves pole Weight to its own shipped action at step
  10.82. It never uses the combined command's circle-to-Diameter inference.
  The exact request contains the active Sketch identity, current
  geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts, one whole geometry index, a
  positive millimetre radius, and explicit driving state. Point and axis
  positions, lines, points, ellipses, multi-target requests, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable external geometry, stale counts,
  stale reference values, extra combined-command fields, solver rejection,
  preflight drift, and postcondition drift are rejected without mutation.
  Reference mode requires the supplied radius to equal the current
  measurement; driving mode is never silently converted to reference mode.
  The completed combined and explicit commands now share one 379-line exact
  circular-size lifecycle instead of duplicating two domain implementations.
  The combined and Radius bindings are only 55 and 51 lines. The shared core
  freezes every pre-existing geometry, constraint, external-geometry, and
  solver record; resolves the command-specific `Radius`/`Diameter` form; calls
  the non-mutating solver diagnostic before a transaction opens; and proves
  the exact type, reference, value, driving/active/virtual state, solved
  measurement, unchanged unrelated state, solver health, and concise receipt.
  Constraint schema/runtime/binding files are 310/196/44 lines. The six
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 2,634 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus six constraint variants total 14,551 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte hard limit.
  The focused real-GUI Radius case is 232 lines, the rolling orchestrator is
  745 lines, and save/reopen remains isolated in a 180-line module. The gate
  refuses a center target, stale reference value, wrong unit, line target,
  multi-target request, unexpected combined-command field, and duplicate
  constraint without history mutation. It then creates an isolated radius-4
  mm circle and applies an exact driving 7.5 mm `Radius`, which specifically
  proves the explicit command does not produce `Diameter` for circles. It
  preserves the human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, reaches
  FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, and proves the exact receipt, named
  transaction, one-step undo/redo restoring 4/7.5 mm states, final
  177-geometry and 248-constraint counts, and every prior operation plus
  explicit Radius after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance,constrain_radius_diameter,constrain_radius`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 189/189 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,737/1,737 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the clean rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative completed Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon
  gate remain green. All packaged touched source/build copies are
  byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean.
  The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design
  phases complete with exit code zero; the Part Design result reports
  `"ok": true`.
- Sketch Diameter is the seventh exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps
  only `Sketcher_ConstrainDiameter`; Angle is the next unfinished Sketch
  action, so the production surface remains fail-closed there. The shipped
  command was traced before implementation: it creates `Diameter` for both
  whole circles and whole circular arcs, rejects B-spline Weight handles, and
  uses the same human multi-selection Equal shortcut as the other size
  commands. Native accepts one exact whole normal circle or circular arc,
  requires Equal to be invoked separately for multi-curve sizing, and rejects
  internal B-spline control geometry. It never aliases the combined command,
  whose arc behavior would incorrectly create `Radius`.
  The request carries the active Sketch identity, exact current
  geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts, one whole geometry index, a
  positive millimetre diameter, and explicit driving state. Point and axis
  positions, lines, points, ellipses, multi-target requests, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable external geometry, stale counts,
  stale reference measurements, extra combined-command fields, solver
  rejection, preflight drift, and postcondition drift all fail without
  mutation. Reference mode requires an exact current diameter; driving mode is
  never silently converted to reference mode.
  Combined Radius/Diameter, explicit Radius, and explicit Diameter now share a
  385-line circular-size lifecycle, with respective 55/51/51-line bindings.
  The core selects only the command-specific constraint form, freezes all
  pre-existing geometry/constraint/external and solver state, performs the
  non-mutating feasibility diagnostic before the transaction, and proves the
  exact reference, type, value, driving/active/virtual state, solved
  measurement, stable unrelated state, solver health, and receipt after the
  append. Constraint schema/runtime/binding files are 326/222/44 lines. The
  seven constraint variants serialize to 2,713 bytes, and the thirty geometry
  plus seven constraint variants total 14,630 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte limit.
  The focused real-GUI Diameter case is 237 lines, the rolling orchestrator is
  757 lines, and save/reopen remains isolated in 182 lines. The gate refuses a
  center target, stale reference value, wrong unit, line target, multi-target
  request, unexpected combined-command field, and duplicate constraint with
  no history mutation. It then creates an isolated radius-3 mm circular arc
  and applies an exact driving 10 mm `Diameter`, proving the solved radius is 5
  mm and, critically, that the explicit action does not use combined
  Radius-on-arc behavior. It preserves the human selection and active
  Sketch/ribbon/workbench, reaches the twenty-entry undo limit, and proves the
  exact receipt, named transaction, one-step undo/redo restoring 3/5 mm
  radius states, final 178-geometry and 249-constraint counts, and all earlier
  operations plus Diameter after FCStd save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance,constrain_radius_diameter,constrain_radius,constrain_diameter`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 214/214 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,762/1,762 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the clean rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle and all 17 protected Part Design phases complete with
  exit code zero; the Part Design result reports `"ok": true`.
- Sketch Angle is the eighth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only
  `Sketcher_ConstrainAngle`; Lock is now the next unfinished Sketch action, so
  the production surface remains fail-closed there. The shipped command and
  its `calculateAngle` endpoint-selection logic were traced before the
  implementation was accepted. Native exposes four explicit durable forms:
  signed orientation for one whole non-axis line, positive span for one whole
  circular arc, a positive internal angle between two exact directed line or
  axis rays, and `AngleViaPoint` for two whole curves through one exact curve
  point. Negative line-line and via-point measurements normalize by swapping
  the two curve references, exactly preserving the positive Sketcher
  constraint branch.
  Unlike the human convenience command, Native does not silently append one
  or more hidden `PointOnObject` constraints for an angle-via-point request.
  The selected point must already lie geometrically on both curves; otherwise
  the request fails with guidance to constrain that topology first. This
  preserves the one-call/one-exact-append contract and leaves Coincident and
  point-on-object behavior to their own explicit actions. Line-line requests
  require `start` or `end` for each normal line ray, while axes are named as
  whole inputs and normalized to their positive root rays. Axis-only
  orientation, whole line-line inputs, non-lines, parallel or collinear rays,
  zero-length lines, non-circular arcs, degenerate arc spans, unsupported
  via-point curves, inexact/off-curve points, internal B-spline geometry,
  duplicate elements, stale counts, stale reference measurements, invalid
  units, form/count mismatches, form-specific out-of-range values, unavailable
  host queries, solver rejection, preflight drift, and postcondition drift are
  all refused without mutation. Reference mode requires the requested value
  to match the exact current measurement; driving mode is never silently
  converted to reference mode.
  The bounded 600-line Angle domain freezes all pre-existing geometry,
  constraint, external-geometry, and solver records, resolves only the named
  form, constructs exactly one `Angle` or `AngleViaPoint`, calls Sketcher's
  non-mutating feasibility diagnostic before opening a transaction, and then
  proves the exact type, ordered references, branch, radians value,
  driving/active/virtual state, solved measurement, stable unrelated state,
  solver health, and concise receipt. Constraint schema/runtime/target files
  are 402/249/328 lines. The eight constraint variants serialize to exactly
  3,019 bytes, and the thirty geometry plus eight constraint variants serialize
  together to exactly 14,935 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte limit.
  The fake-host proof is isolated behind a 168-line Angle mixin, and 46 focused
  Angle tests cover every supported form and the refusal boundaries above.
  The real-GUI case is 365 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 769 lines, and
  save/reopen remains isolated in 184 lines. The gate creates two exact lines
  at 60 degrees, refuses a whole ray, stale reference value, wrong unit,
  wrong form, parallel axis ray, duplicate element, and redundant finished
  constraint without history mutation, then applies one exact driving
  45-degree line-line `Angle`. It proves the exact ordered references and
  radians value, preserved human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench,
  newest named transaction at FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo limit, exact receipt,
  one-step undo/redo restoring the 60/45-degree states, final 180-geometry and
  250-constraint counts, and every earlier operation plus Angle after FCStd
  save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance,constrain_radius_diameter,constrain_radius,constrain_diameter,constrain_angle`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 262/262 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,810/1,810 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt runtime passes the clean rolling Sketch lifecycle; the
  representative Model bracket workflow and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained, and all 17 protected Part
  Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Sketch Lock is the ninth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only
  `Sketcher_ConstrainLock`; the live unified Coincident action is now the next
  unfinished Sketch action, so production remains fail-closed at
  `Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified`. The shipped command was traced before
  implementation. It does not create a constraint named Lock: one selected
  point receives an absolute `DistanceX` plus `DistanceY`, while multiple
  selected vertices use the last point as a reference and add a relative
  `DistanceX`/`DistanceY` pair for every earlier point.
  Native preserves those intrinsic two-constraint semantics without exposing
  the human command's unbounded fan-out. One call explicitly chooses either
  one absolute point or one ordered target/reference point pair. Additional
  relative targets are separate semantic calls. The two forms are a closed
  nested schema union, so absolute position fields cannot appear in a relative
  request and relative reference/offset fields cannot appear in an absolute
  request. Both forms require the expected current signed X/Y position or
  reference-minus-target offset in millimetres. The expectation must already
  match the live geometry for driving and reference modes: Lock freezes the
  current relationship and is never repurposed as a move operation.
  Exact line endpoints, curve centers/endpoints, standalone points, external
  points, signed and zero values, and the Sketch origin as a relative reference
  are supported. The origin as the target, whole geometry, duplicate target
  and reference points, mixed or incomplete forms, stale measurements, invalid
  or unbounded coordinates, grouped members, internal-alignment geometry,
  unavailable point lookup, stale topology, solver rejection, an inexact
  two-proposal feasibility result, preflight drift, and postcondition drift all
  fail without mutation. Driving mode remains driving and reference mode
  remains reference; fixed/external state is never used to silently change the
  requested mode.
  The bounded 371-line Lock domain freezes all pre-existing geometry,
  constraint, external-geometry, and solver records, constructs exactly the
  ordered X/Y pair, diagnoses both proposals together before a transaction
  opens, appends both through one host call, and proves both exact indices,
  types, ordered references, values, driving/active/virtual state, unchanged
  measurement, stable unrelated state, solver health, and one concise receipt.
  The shared constraint-append module is now a 357-line sequence-capable core:
  existing one-constraint operations retain their exact wrapper while Lock
  uses the same diagnostic, append, and verification invariants for two
  constraints. Constraint schema/runtime files are 487/274 lines. The nine
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 5,123 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus nine constraint variants serialize together to exactly 17,039
  bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte limit.
  Thirty-one focused Lock tests cover absolute/relative driving and reference
  pairs, origin and external references, signed offsets, schema discrimination,
  exact pair diagnostics, and every refusal boundary above. The real-GUI case
  is 257 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 781 lines, and save/reopen remains
  isolated in 186 lines. The gate creates one exact point, refuses a stale
  position, whole target, origin target, mixed form, out-of-range coordinate,
  and redundant finished Lock without history mutation, then appends exact
  driving `DistanceX` and `DistanceY` constraints in one named semantic
  transaction. It proves the point remains at 290/160 mm, exact constraint
  values and references, preserved human selection and active
  Sketch/ribbon/workbench, FreeCAD's twenty-entry undo cap, one-step undo
  removing both constraints, one-step redo restoring both, final 181-geometry
  and 252-constraint counts, and every earlier operation plus Lock after FCStd
  save/reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK operations=create_point,create_line,create_polyline,create_arc,create3_point_arc,create_arc_of_ellipse,create_arc_of_hyperbola,create_arc_of_parabola,create_circle,create3_point_circle,create_ellipse,create3_point_ellipse,create_rectangle,create_center_rectangle,create_oblong,create_triangle,create_square,create_pentagon,create_hexagon,create_heptagon,create_octagon,create_regular_polygon,create_slot,create_arc_slot,create_b_spline,create_periodic_b_spline,create_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_periodic_b_spline_by_interpolation,create_text,toggle_construction,infer_dimension,constrain_distance_x,constrain_distance_y,constrain_distance,constrain_radius_diameter,constrain_radius,constrain_diameter,constrain_angle,constrain_lock`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 295/295 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,843/1,843 green with four intentional
  skips. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle, representative Model bracket
  workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All packaged touched
  source/build copies are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff, and
  `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle
  finishes fully constrained, and all 17 protected Part Design phases complete
  with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Sketch Coincident is the tenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainCoincidentUnified` action. The shipped
  command was traced through every selection branch before implementation.
  Native exposes its three durable semantics as a closed nested union:
  `point_point` creates one exact `Coincident` between two explicit points,
  `point_on_object` creates one exact `PointOnObject` from an explicit point to
  one whole curve or axis, and `concentric` normalizes two explicit whole
  circles, circular arcs, ellipses, or elliptical arcs to exact center-point
  `Coincident` references. One call always names one ordered pair. The human
  command's unbounded selection fan-out is split into separate semantic calls,
  and its destructive Tangent-replacement branch is refused with direction to
  use the future explicit Tangent operation rather than silently deleting an
  existing constraint. Production remains fail-closed at the next live action,
  `Sketcher_ConstrainHorVer`.
  The 461-line domain freezes all geometry, constraints, external geometry,
  and solver diagnostics before mutation, diagnoses the exact one-constraint
  proposal outside a transaction, revalidates the target, appends exactly one
  constraint, and proves its index, type, ordered references, driving/active/
  virtual state, absent dimensional value, unchanged unrelated metadata, and
  solved geometric postcondition. Already coincident points, already-on-curve
  points, already-concentric conics, same-geometry non-B-spline endpoints,
  wrong point/whole positions, unsupported conics, point geometry used as a
  curve, own-curve targets, mixed or incomplete forms, hidden Tangent
  substitution, grouped members, internal-alignment geometry, missing or
  detached external geometry, unavailable host queries, stale topology,
  solver rejection, feasibility side effects, and preflight/postcondition
  drift all fail without opening or retaining a mutation.
  Thirty-five focused domain tests plus exact schema tests cover all three
  forms, all four concentric conic types, the origin, axes, external geometry,
  B-spline endpoints, schema discrimination, and the refusal boundaries above.
  The isolated real-GUI case is 460 lines, the rolling orchestrator remains 794
  lines, and save/reopen remains isolated in 190 lines. The gate creates two
  distinct points and makes them coincident, places another point on the fixed
  horizontal axis, and makes two new circles concentric. It proves exact
  serialized `Coincident` and `PointOnObject` constructors, pre/post geometric
  measurements, preserved human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench,
  named transactions and receipts, one-step undo/redo for every form, and all
  three constraints after FCStd save/reopen at final 186-geometry and
  255-constraint counts. It emits the complete rolling marker ending in
  `constrain_angle,constrain_lock,constrain_coincident`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 332/332 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,880/1,880 green with four intentional
  skips. The ten constraint variants serialize to exactly 8,056 bytes; the
  thirty geometry plus ten constraint variants total 19,973 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Automatic Horizontal/Vertical is the eleventh exact `sketch.constraint`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainHorVer` action. The
  shipped command was traced through its complete selection and inference
  logic before implementation. Native exposes the two durable one-target
  forms: one exact whole straight line, or one exact ordered pair of points.
  It measures the target delta and infers Horizontal when `abs(dx) > abs(dy)`
  and Vertical when `abs(dy) > abs(dx)`. The request must state that expected
  inference explicitly, so stale or misunderstood geometry is refused before
  mutation. Exactly diagonal and numerically ambiguous targets are refused
  instead of inheriting the human command's arbitrary Vertical tie-break. The
  human command's multi-edge fan-out and multi-point chain construction are
  split into separate semantic calls. Production remains fail-closed at the
  next live action, `Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal`.
  The 391-line domain freezes geometry, constraints, external geometry, and
  solver diagnostics before mutation, diagnoses one exact proposal outside a
  transaction, revalidates the target, appends exactly one `Horizontal` or
  `Vertical` constraint, and proves its index, type, ordered references,
  driving/active/virtual state, absent dimensional value, unchanged unrelated
  metadata, and solved geometric postcondition. Zero-length lines, coincident
  point pairs, exact or near-diagonal ambiguity, stale expected inference,
  non-line whole targets, wrong point/whole positions, origin or axis used as
  a whole target, redundant Horizontal/Vertical/Block constraints, grouped
  members, internal-alignment geometry, missing host queries, stale topology,
  solver rejection, feasibility side effects, and preflight/postcondition
  drift all fail without opening or retaining a mutation.
  Thirty-one focused domain tests plus exact schema tests cover both forms,
  both inference directions, signed deltas, the origin, axes, external
  geometry, center points, and the refusal boundaries above. The isolated
  real-GUI case is 393 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 808 lines, and
  save/reopen remains isolated in 194 lines. The gate first refuses a truly
  diagonal line, then proves stale-inference, nonwhole-target, and stale-count
  refusals on a near-horizontal line before appending one exact Horizontal
  constraint. It then appends one exact Vertical constraint between two
  points. It proves pre/post deltas, exact serialized constructors, preserved
  human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, named transactions and
  receipts, one-step undo/redo for each form, and both constraints after FCStd
  save/reopen at final 190-geometry and 257-constraint counts. It emits the
  complete rolling marker ending in
  `constrain_coincident,constrain_horizontal_vertical`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 365/365 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,913/1,913 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Horizontal/Vertical schema is exactly 1,772 bytes;
  all eleven constraint variants serialize to exactly 10,030 bytes, and the
  thirty geometry plus eleven constraint variants total 21,947 bytes against
  the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Explicit Horizontal is the twelfth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and
  maps only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainHorizontal` action. The shared shipped
  `horVerActivated` and `horVerApplyConstraint` paths were traced through both
  explicit-Horizontal selection sequences before implementation. Native keeps
  the two durable one-target forms: one exact whole internal straight line
  creates `Sketcher.Constraint('Horizontal', geometry_index)`, and one exact
  ordered point pair creates the five-reference Horizontal constructor. One
  call always creates one constraint. The human command's multi-edge fan-out
  and adjacent-pair construction across an arbitrary point sequence are split
  into separate semantic calls. The closed explicit contract deliberately has
  no inference or expected-inference field: a line or point pair that currently
  appears more vertical is still made Horizontal exactly as requested.
  Production remains fail-closed at the next live action,
  `Sketcher_ConstrainVertical`.
  Automatic and explicit axis alignment now share one 502-line lifecycle
  domain, while their operation-specific type guards and bindings remain in
  63- and 65-line modules. The common domain freezes geometry, constraints,
  external geometry, and solver diagnostics before mutation, diagnoses the
  exact one-constraint proposal outside a transaction, revalidates the target,
  appends exactly one constraint, and proves its index, type, ordered
  references, driving/active/virtual state, absent dimensional value,
  unchanged unrelated metadata, and solved zero-Y-delta postcondition. This
  factoring preserves the already completed automatic action without copying
  its mutation or verification machinery into Horizontal and the upcoming
  Vertical action. Zero-length lines, coincident point pairs, non-line whole
  targets, point/whole form mistakes, fixed axes used as whole targets,
  existing Horizontal/Vertical/Block constraints, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable point or constraint queries, stale
  topology, solver rejection, feasibility side effects, and preflight or
  postcondition drift all fail without opening or retaining a mutation.
  Twenty-six focused Horizontal domain tests plus exact schema tests cover both
  constructor forms, signed direction, a deliberately vertical-looking line
  and point pair, the origin, external geometry, conic centers, the closed
  no-inference contract, and the refusal boundaries above. All thirty-one
  automatic Horizontal/Vertical tests remain green after the common-domain
  extraction. The isolated real-GUI Horizontal case is 337 lines, the rolling
  orchestrator is 823 lines, and save/reopen remains isolated in 198 lines.
  The gate creates a 2-by-8-mm line, proves axis, nonwhole, stale-count, and
  unexpected-inference refusals, then appends the exact line Horizontal
  constraint. It creates a 4-by-8-mm ordered point pair and appends the exact
  point-pair Horizontal constraint. It proves pre/post deltas, exact serialized
  constructors, preserved human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench,
  named transactions and receipts, one-step undo/redo for each form, and both
  constraints after FCStd save/reopen at final 193-geometry and 259-constraint
  counts. It emits the complete rolling marker ending in
  `constrain_horizontal_vertical,constrain_horizontal`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 407/407 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,941/1,941 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Horizontal schema is exactly 1,670 bytes; all twelve
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 10,197 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus twelve constraint variants total 22,114 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Explicit Vertical is the thirteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and
  maps only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainVertical` action. The shipped command
  delegates its one-edge and two-point selection sequences to the same traced
  handler as automatic alignment and explicit Horizontal. Native preserves
  those two durable one-target forms: one exact whole internal straight line
  creates `Sketcher.Constraint('Vertical', geometry_index)`, and one exact
  ordered point pair creates the five-reference Vertical constructor. One call
  always creates one constraint; arbitrary selected-edge fan-out and adjacent
  pair generation across a point sequence remain separate semantic calls. The
  explicit closed contract has no inference field, so a currently
  horizontal-looking target is still made Vertical exactly as requested.
  Production remains fail-closed at the next live action,
  `Sketcher_ConstrainParallel`.
  Vertical is a 60-line guarded binding over the same 502-line alignment
  lifecycle proven by automatic Horizontal/Vertical and explicit Horizontal.
  It therefore shares their frozen preflight state, side-effect-free exact
  solver diagnosis, one-constraint append, exact serialized-reference proof,
  solver-state comparison, and postcondition measurement without duplicating
  mutation logic. It proves a zero-X-delta result while retaining the same
  refusal policy for zero-length lines, coincident point pairs, non-line whole
  targets, point/whole form mistakes, fixed axes used as whole targets,
  existing Horizontal/Vertical/Block constraints, grouped members,
  internal-alignment geometry, unavailable host queries, stale topology,
  solver rejection, feasibility side effects, and preflight/postcondition
  drift. Every refusal occurs before a retained mutation.
  Twenty-six focused Vertical domain tests plus exact schema tests cover both
  constructors, signed direction, a deliberately horizontal-looking line and
  point pair, the origin, external geometry, conic centers, the closed
  no-inference contract, and all shared refusal boundaries. The isolated
  real-GUI Vertical case is 337 lines, the rolling orchestrator is 835 lines,
  and save/reopen remains isolated in 200 lines. The gate creates an 8-by-2-mm
  line, proves axis, nonwhole, stale-count, and unexpected-inference refusals,
  then appends the exact line Vertical constraint. It creates an 8-by-4-mm
  ordered point pair and appends the exact point-pair Vertical constraint. It
  proves pre/post deltas, exact serialized constructors, preserved human
  selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, named transactions and
  receipts, one-step undo/redo for both forms, and both constraints after
  FCStd save/reopen at final 196-geometry and 261-constraint counts. It emits
  the complete rolling marker ending in
  `constrain_horizontal,constrain_vertical`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 435/435 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,969/1,969 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Vertical schema is exactly 1,668 bytes; all thirteen
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 10,257 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus thirteen constraint variants total 22,174 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Parallel is the fourteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only
  the live `Sketcher_ConstrainParallel` action. The shipped command was traced
  through its selection-mode and preselection paths: it accepts internal line
  pairs, one internal line with either axis, and one internal line with
  external line geometry, then creates
  `Sketcher.Constraint('Parallel', first_index, second_index)`. Native exposes
  exactly one ordered pair of distinct whole straight lines per call and
  requires at least one editable internal line. The human command's arbitrary
  selected-line chain is split into separate semantic calls rather than
  silently producing adjacent constraints. Input ordering is preserved in the
  exact constructor and result. Production remains fail-closed at the next
  live action, `Sketcher_ConstrainPerpendicular`.
  The 302-line domain freezes geometry, constraints, external geometry, and
  solver diagnostics before mutation; rejects invalid geometry before solver
  work; diagnoses one exact proposal without opening a transaction; rechecks
  the complete target; appends exactly one constraint; and proves index, type,
  ordered references, driving/active/virtual state, absent dimensional value,
  unchanged unrelated metadata, and the solved angular postcondition. Its
  concise result reports only the angular error to the nearest parallel
  direction before and after. Same-line targets, fewer or more than two
  targets, point rather than whole selections, non-line curves and points,
  zero-length lines, two fixed axes/external lines, an existing Parallel in
  either order, grouped members, internal-alignment geometry, unavailable host
  queries, stale or missing external geometry, stale topology, solver
  rejection, feasibility side effects, and preflight/postcondition drift all
  fail without a retained mutation.
  Twenty-seven focused domain tests plus exact schema tests cover internal
  pairs, both orderings with axes and external lines, already anti-parallel
  geometry without a constraint, exact serialized references, all closed
  contract failures, and the refusal boundaries above. Fake-host solver
  behavior is isolated in 41 lines rather than added to the shared test host.
  The isolated real-GUI Parallel case is 380 lines, the rolling orchestrator is
  847 lines, and save/reopen remains isolated in 202 lines. The gate first
  proves same-line, two-axis, nonwhole, and stale-count refusals. It then
  creates and independently proves an internal/internal pair, an internal line
  against the fixed horizontal axis, and an external/internal pair against the
  live imported external line. Every form proves pre/post angular error,
  exact ordered constructors, preserved human selection and active
  Sketch/ribbon/workbench, named transactions and receipts, independent
  one-step undo/redo, and all three constraints after FCStd save/reopen at
  final 200-geometry and 264-constraint counts. It emits the complete rolling
  marker ending in `constrain_vertical,constrain_parallel`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 464/464 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 1,998/1,998 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Parallel schema is exactly 1,228 bytes; all fourteen
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 10,730 bytes, and the thirty
  geometry plus fourteen constraint variants total 22,647 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Perpendicular is the fifteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainPerpendicular` action. The shipped command
  was traced through every selection branch in
  `Sketcher/Gui/CommandConstraints.cpp`: two whole curves, one endpoint and
  one curve, two endpoints, two points and one line, and two curves through
  one point. Native represents those meanings as five explicit discriminated
  forms; it never reads the human selection or invents hidden construction
  geometry. The explicit via-point form adds and reports only the required
  durable PointOnObject support constraints in the same atomic transaction.
  Production remains fail-closed at the next live action,
  `Sketcher_ConstrainTangent`.
  Real-host probing exposed an unsafe FreeCAD five-reference constructor: its
  feasibility diagnosis segfaults in `GCS::ConstraintPerpendicular::rescale`,
  and direct append alternatives either segfault or can retain a partially
  redundant constraint. Native therefore accepts the point-pair/line form
  only when the two points are the explicit start and end of one straight
  line, compiling it to the stable two-line constructor. Arbitrary point pairs
  refuse with a precise instruction to create the line first. Likewise, the
  human command's special two-conic branch is not imitated because it silently
  creates a construction point and supporting constraints; Native requires an
  explicit existing point and the via-point form instead.
  The 192-line domain, 462-line target validator, and 281-line measurement
  module freeze geometry, constraints, external geometry, and solver state;
  validate the exact form before diagnosis; recheck topology immediately
  before mutation; apply the complete constructor set atomically; and prove
  exact serialized references, constraint state, allowed orientation datum,
  supporting constraints, unchanged unrelated metadata, and the solved
  perpendicular postcondition. Invalid positions or curve classes, duplicate
  or stale targets, fixed-only targets, implicit conic helpers, unsupported
  arbitrary point pairs, solver rejection, feasibility side effects, and
  preflight or postcondition drift all refuse without a retained mutation.
  Twenty-four focused domain tests plus exact schema and fail-closed surface
  tests cover all five forms, constructor ordering, support-constraint
  reporting, state counts, atomic rollback, and every refusal boundary above.
  The real-GUI case independently proves line/line, line/circle,
  endpoint/curve, endpoint/endpoint, the safe point-pair/line form, and an
  ellipse/line via-point form. It also proves preserved human selection and
  active Sketch/ribbon/workbench, named transactions and receipts, exact
  one-step undo/redo, no mutation of earlier rolling geometry, and every
  result after FCStd save/reopen at final 216-geometry and 275-constraint
  counts. The rolling marker now ends in
  `constrain_parallel,constrain_perpendicular`.
  The focused constraint/schema/dispatcher suite is 473/473 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,024/2,024 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Perpendicular schema is exactly 6,190 bytes; all
  fifteen constraint variants serialize to exactly 16,181 bytes, and the
  thirty geometry plus fifteen constraint variants total 28,097 bytes against
  the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes fully constrained at DoF zero, and all 17
  protected Part Design phases complete with exit code zero and `"ok": true`.
- Tangent is the sixteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only the
  live `Sketcher_ConstrainTangent` action. The shipped command was traced
  through every selection and substitution branch in
  `Sketcher/Gui/CommandConstraints.cpp`: two whole curves, one endpoint and
  one curve, two endpoints, two curves through one explicit point, and the
  hidden Coincident/PointOnObject/whole-Tangent substitutions performed by
  the human command family. Native exposes the four constructive meanings as
  `curve_curve`, `endpoint_curve`, `endpoint_endpoint`, and
  `curves_via_point`; destructive substitutions are separate
  `replace_with_endpoint_curve` and `replace_with_endpoint_endpoint` forms
  that require the exact current constraint index. Direct forms refuse and
  identify the replacement form and index instead of silently deleting a
  support constraint. Production remains fail-closed at the next live action,
  `Sketcher_ConstrainEqual`.
  Native never copies the human command's implicit conic helper-point branch.
  Whole-curve Tangent is limited to lines, circles, and circular arcs;
  ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas require an explicit existing point, and
  B-splines require an explicit endpoint or via-point form. Required
  PointOnObject support for a via-point target is appended and reported in the
  same transaction, while an exact existing support is reused. Every form
  requires an editable internal target and preserves caller ordering.
  Replacement preflight is non-mutating: Sketcher now provides the additive
  `diagnoseConstraintReplacement(index, constraints)` API, which evaluates a
  hypothetical remove-one/add-one solver set, returns the same complete
  diagnostics as `diagnoseAdditionalConstraints`, and restores the live
  solver state. The Sketcher target builds cleanly, its generated Python
  binding is present, and a serial real-host probe proves accepted endpoint
  Tangent replacement while geometry, constraint topology/type, and live
  diagnostics remain unchanged. Mutation then deletes only the named index,
  appends exactly one replacement, and verifies every surviving constraint
  after deterministic reindexing; no broad point-based deletion is used.
  The 270-line domain, 614-line target validator, 222-line measurement module,
  and 201-line shared curve-differential helper freeze geometry, constraints,
  external geometry, and solver state; diagnose the exact complete proposal;
  recheck the target immediately before mutation; and prove exact serialized
  references, driving/active/virtual state, allowed pointwise orientation
  datum, support constraints, unchanged unrelated topology and metadata,
  physical contact, point-on-curve support, and the solved tangent
  postcondition. Existing constraints in either order, wrong replacement
  indices or references, inactive/reference/virtual replacements, fixed-only
  targets, implicit helper geometry, stale state, solver rejection,
  feasibility side effects, and preflight or postcondition drift all refuse
  without a retained mutation.
  Fifty-one focused Tangent tests plus the exact schema and dispatcher gates
  cover all six forms, line/line, line/circle, circle/circle, explicit
  B-spline endpoints, support append/reuse, all four allowed replacement
  source/destination paths, preservation and reindexing of an unrelated
  same-point constraint, closed contracts, and every refusal boundary above.
  The complete exact-constraint suite is 515/515 green. Fake Tangent solving
  is isolated in a 265-line mixin and recognizes already-satisfied legacy
  Slot, Oblong, and Arc Slot tangencies without moving their geometry.
  The 685-line real-GUI case independently proves all constructive forms and
  all replacement source types. It proves failed direct substitutions create
  no undo entry; preserved human selection and active Sketch/ribbon/workbench;
  the named single transaction; exact replacement of a non-final constraint
  while its following Horizontal constraint survives and reindexes; atomic
  one-step undo/redo restoring both topology and geometry; and every result
  after FCStd save/reopen at final 240-geometry and 291-constraint counts. The
  rolling marker now ends in
  `constrain_perpendicular,constrain_tangent`.
  The full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,077/2,077 green with four
  intentional skips. The individual Tangent schema is exactly 6,920 bytes;
  all sixteen constraint variants serialize to exactly 22,350 bytes, and the
  thirty geometry plus sixteen constraint variants total 34,266 bytes against
  the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The rebuilt rolling Sketch lifecycle,
  representative Model bracket workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are
  green. All packaged touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched
  Python passes Ruff, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript integration returns zero, and all 17 protected Part Design phases
  report `PHASE_OK`, final exit code zero, and `"ok": true`.
- Equal is the seventeenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only the
  live `Sketcher_ConstrainEqual` action. The shipped command and solver paths
  were traced before implementation: line segments share length; circles and
  circular arcs share radius; ellipses/elliptical arcs and
  hyperbolas/hyperbolic arcs share both major and minor radii; parabolic arcs
  share focal length; and B-spline control-point handles share their owning
  pole weight. Whole B-spline curves, axes, unsupported or mixed families,
  group/internal geometry other than exact B-spline control-point handles, and
  selections containing more than one fixed or external target are refused.
  Native accepts an ordered chain of two through seventeen whole compatible
  edges and atomically appends adjacent Equal constraints. Direct and
  transitive membership in the existing Equal graph are both rejected before
  mutation rather than relying on the host solver's permissive redundant-call
  diagnosis.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchEqual.py` is a 175-line transaction domain,
  `SteveCADNativeSketchEqualMeasure.py` is a 196-line family/postcondition
  module, and `SteveCADNativeSketchEqualTarget.py` is a 305-line exact target
  validator. They freeze geometry, constraints, external geometry, solver
  state, owning B-spline alignment, and family measurements; diagnose the
  complete proposed constraint chain; recheck every target immediately before
  mutation; and prove exact serialized references, constraint flags, unchanged
  unrelated topology, and the family-specific solved postcondition afterward.
  Sketcher now exposes the existing C++
  `Constraint::InternalAlignmentIndex` as an additive read-only Python property
  so B-spline pole identity is inspected exactly rather than inferred from
  constraint order. The rebuilt Sketcher target and serial real-host probes
  prove all six supported families, including true B-spline pole-weight
  synchronization.
  Sixty-two focused Equal/schema tests cover all families, ordered chains,
  direct and transitive duplicate refusal, axes, wrong positions and counts,
  mixed and unsupported families, whole B-splines, malformed or mismatched
  pole owners, fixed/external limits, stale state, solver rejection,
  feasibility side effects, and preflight/postcondition drift without retained
  mutation. The complete Native Sketch suite is 804/804 green, and the full
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,106/2,106 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Equal schema is exactly 1,226 bytes; all seventeen
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 22,815 bytes; and the thirty
  geometry plus seventeen constraint variants total 34,731 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. To keep the next constraint from creating a
  monolith, the 993-line constraint schema was split without changing a single
  serialized byte: the capability module is now 743 lines, curve-relation
  schemas are 240 lines, and shared exact-element fragments are 33 lines.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves all six families, atomic chain
  creation, named one-step undo/redo, preserved human selection and edit
  boundary, and FCStd save/reopen at 16 geometry and 11 constraints. The
  accumulated GUI lifecycle also proves the existing 240-geometry,
  291-constraint Sketch, then performs a human switch to a separate Equal
  Sketch and starts a newly frozen provider turn for that human-selected edit
  target; a stale turn is never reused across the context change. The final
  rolling marker now ends in `constrain_tangent,constrain_equal`. The rebuilt
  rolling Sketch lifecycle, representative Model bracket workflow, and
  527-action live ribbon gate are green. All twelve packaged touched
  source/build files are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff formatting
  and lint, and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher VibeScript
  lifecycle finishes with four geometry, eleven constraints, and DoF zero;
  all 17 protected Part Design phases report `PHASE_OK`, final exit code zero,
  and `"ok": true`.
- Symmetric is the eighteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only
  the live `Sketcher_ConstrainSymmetric` action. The shipped GUI command,
  Python constructors, and solver paths were traced before implementation.
  Native exposes four explicit forms rather than selection inference: two
  exact points about a whole straight line or Sketch axis, two exact points
  about an exact point or root, one open curve's endpoints about a whole
  straight line or axis, and one open curve's endpoints about an exact point.
  The line-reference form emits the exact five-reference host constructor and
  the point-reference form emits the exact six-reference constructor. Subject
  point order is canonical, and the curve forms expand to exact start/end
  references so an equivalent existing endpoint-pair Symmetric constraint is
  also refused as a duplicate.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchSymmetric.py` is a 180-line transaction domain,
  `SteveCADNativeSketchSymmetricMeasure.py` is a 148-line reflection and
  midpoint postcondition module, and
  `SteveCADNativeSketchSymmetricTarget.py` is a 334-line exact target validator.
  They support line segments, circular, elliptical, hyperbolic, and parabolic
  arcs, and non-periodic B-splines; full conics, periodic B-splines,
  non-straight symmetry lines, self-reference, own-endpoint references,
  group/internal geometry, duplicate definitions, all-fixed targets, and
  stale geometry, constraint, or external-reference counts are refused before
  mutation. Preflight freezes geometry, constraints, external geometry, and
  solver diagnostics; diagnoses the exact proposed constraint; proves that
  feasibility analysis had no side effect; rechecks the target immediately
  before mutation; appends exactly one constraint; and verifies exact
  serialized references, flags, unchanged unrelated topology and metadata,
  no new solver issues, reflection error, and midpoint error afterward.
  Seventy-seven focused Symmetric/schema tests cover all four forms, every
  supported curve family, root, both axes, internal and external line/point
  references, editable references with fixed subjects, order-independent and
  curve/endpoint duplicate detection, exact constructors, closed schemas,
  wrong fields, positions, counts, target types, degenerate lines, blocked,
  group, and internal geometry, solver rejection, incomplete diagnostics,
  feasibility side effects, preflight drift, postcondition drift, and exact
  runtime routing. The complete Native Sketch suite is 846/846 green, and the
  full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,148/2,148 green with four intentional
  skips. The individual Symmetric schema is exactly 5,352 bytes; all eighteen
  constraint variants serialize to exactly 27,420 bytes; and the thirty
  geometry plus eighteen constraint variants total 39,336 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The next incomplete Block action remains the
  fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves eleven independent Symmetric
  constraints across every form and supported open-curve family, root, axes,
  and external references. It also proves invalid and duplicate paths create
  no undo entry, human selection and the active
  Sketch/ribbon/workbench remain unchanged, the named transaction is one
  semantic undo/redo step, and all 21 geometry and 11 constraints survive
  exact FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated Sketch lifecycle performs another
  human edit-target switch to a separate Symmetric Sketch, freezes a new
  provider turn, replays the same case after the existing 240-geometry,
  291-constraint and Equal sketches, and reopens all three successfully. Its
  final marker now ends in
  `constrain_tangent,constrain_equal,constrain_symmetric`.
  The rebuilt Sketcher and SteveCAD script targets, representative Model bracket
  workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All ten packaged
  touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff,
  and `git diff --check` is clean. The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle
  finishes with four geometry, eleven constraints, and DoF zero; all 17
  protected Part Design phases report `PHASE_OK`, final exit code zero, and
  `"ok": true`.
- Block is the nineteenth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps only the
  live `Sketcher_ConstrainBlock` action. The shipped GUI command, exact
  `Sketcher.Constraint("Block", index)` constructor, geometry-facade state,
  and solver behavior were traced before implementation. Native accepts a
  bounded ordered set of one through sixteen distinct, exact, whole, internal
  edges across every shipped primary edge family: line, circle, circular arc,
  ellipse, elliptical arc, hyperbolic arc, parabolic arc, and B-spline. It also
  accepts exact human-selectable ellipse major/minor, hyperbola major/minor,
  parabola focal-axis, and B-spline control-point internal handles. Axes,
  external geometry, vertices, point-like internal alignment geometry, group
  members, duplicate selections, existing Block constraints, and malformed
  blocked facades without matching constraints are refused before mutation.
  An exact group handle remains a valid whole-edge target; creation and
  behavior of Constraint Groups remains the next unfinished action.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchBlock.py` is a 204-line atomic transaction domain and
  `SteveCADNativeSketchBlockTarget.py` is a 144-line exact target validator.
  Preflight freezes all geometry, constraints, external geometry, and solver
  issues; proves counts and exact targets are current; diagnoses the complete
  proposed Block set on copied geometry; proves diagnosis did not alter live
  state; appends one exact Block per selected edge; and verifies exact
  constraint indices, references, facade flags, unchanged unrelated topology
  and metadata, unchanged canonical geometry records except the selected
  `blocked` transitions, and no new solver issues before commit. The additive
  Sketcher `diagnoseBlockConstraints` API deep-copies complete geometry with
  extensions, applies proposed Block facade state only on those copies, solves
  current plus proposed constraints, and returns full diagnostics while the
  existing generic diagnostic API remains unchanged.
  Thirty-eight Block domain tests and 77 focused Block/schema tests cover all
  eight edge families, all six internal-handle kinds, the full sixteen-target
  batch, closed and bounded schemas, exact constructors and routing, axes,
  external geometry, points, positions, group members and handles, duplicate,
  existing, and malformed targets, stale counts, solver rejection, incomplete
  or inconsistent diagnostics, diagnostic side effects, preflight drift, and
  postcondition movement or missing Blocked state. The complete Native Sketch
  suite is 886/886 green, and the full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is
  2,188/2,188 green with four intentional skips. The individual Block schema
  is exactly 1,226 bytes; all nineteen constraint variants serialize to exactly
  27,885 bytes; the thirty geometry variants serialize to 11,917 bytes; and
  both surfaces total 39,801 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  Constraint Group remains the fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves 16 Block targets over 23 real geometry
  fixtures and all supported edge and internal-handle families, with 32 total
  fixture and Block constraints. It directly proves copied diagnosis accepts
  the exact proposal without altering live geometry, facade flags, or
  constraints; invalid and duplicate calls create no undo entry; human
  selection and active context remain unchanged; the named transaction is one
  semantic undo/redo step; and exact geometry, constraint references, and
  Blocked flags survive FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated Sketch lifecycle
  switches to a separate human-selected Block Sketch, freezes a fresh provider
  turn, replays the case after the existing geometry, Equal, and Symmetric
  cases, and reopens all results successfully. Its final marker now ends in
  `constrain_tangent,constrain_equal,constrain_symmetric,constrain_block`.
  The rebuilt Sketcher and SteveCAD script targets, representative Model bracket
  workflow, and 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All eleven packaged
  touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff,
  `python -m compileall` and `git diff --check` are clean, and the largest
  rolling integration module remains 991 lines. The protected Sketcher
  VibeScript lifecycle finishes with four geometry, eleven constraints, and
  DoF zero; all 17 protected Part Design phases report `PHASE_OK`, final exit
  code zero, and `"ok": true`.
- Constraint Group is the twentieth exact `sketch.constraint` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_ConstrainGroup` action. The shipped GUI command,
  `Sketcher.Constraint("Group", elements)` constructor, persistent geometry-tag
  behavior, solver semantics, and internal-geometry cleanup were traced before
  implementation. Native accepts an ordered set of two through sixteen
  distinct, exact, whole, internal primary geometries, including standalone
  points, construction geometry, every shipped curve family, and an already
  Blocked member. Axes, external geometry, point positions, internal-alignment
  geometry, duplicate targets, existing Group or Text handles and members,
  nested groups, stale counts, existing solver issues, unavailable or duplicate
  persistent tags, and invalid, infinite, or zero-height combined bounds are
  refused before mutation.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchGroup.py` is a 163-line atomic transaction domain,
  `SteveCADNativeSketchGroupTarget.py` is a 259-line exact target validator, and
  `SteveCADNativeSketchGroupState.py` is a 328-line exact postcondition verifier.
  Preflight freezes all geometry, constraints, external geometry, solver state,
  persistent identities, and the finite OCC bounding box. Creation follows the
  human command exactly: it removes only unused exposed internal geometry for
  selected conic or B-spline parents, adds one construction-line handle from
  `(minX,minY)` to `(minX,maxY)`, and appends one Group whose full ordered
  element list starts with that handle. Verification proves the precise allowed
  cleanup, unchanged surviving tagged geometry and unrelated constraints, the
  exact new handle and Group, and no solver issues. General Sketch state remains
  capped at eight Group/Text elements; Group additionally verifies the complete
  raw host element list, including the maximum seventeen handle-plus-member
  entries, so no global return cap or 65,536-byte schema limit was raised.
  Thirty-six focused Group domain tests and 77 focused Group/schema tests cover
  all supported families, construction and Blocked members, the full
  sixteen-member boundary, exact constructor and runtime routing, allowed
  internal cleanup and index rewrites, every target refusal above, stale state,
  preflight drift, and exact postcondition failures. The complete Native Sketch
  suite is 924/924 green, and the full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is
  2,226/2,226 green with four intentional skips. The individual Group schema is
  exactly 1,226 bytes; all twenty constraint variants serialize to exactly
  28,350 bytes; the thirty geometry variants serialize to 11,917 bytes; and the
  combined surfaces total 40,266 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  Driving/Reference Toggle is now the fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle creates a ten-member Group across 12 real
  primary fixtures covering a point, construction geometry, every curve
  family, and a Blocked member. It proves the exact three-constraint final
  state, deletion of only 18 exposed internal geometries and their 19 dependent
  constraints, existing member constraints being ignored by Group semantics,
  invalid-call no-ops, unchanged selection and active edit context, one named
  undo/redo step, nested-Group refusal, and exact FCStd save/reopen. The rolling
  lifecycle switches to a separate human-selected Group Sketch, freezes a fresh
  provider turn, replays and reopens it after every earlier geometry and
  constraint case, and reports all 51 implemented operations ending in
  `constrain_equal,constrain_symmetric,constrain_block,constrain_group`.
  The rebuilt Sketcher and SteveCAD script targets, representative Model bracket
  workflow, and exact 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All twelve packaged
  touched source/build copies are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff and
  `python -m compileall`, `git diff --check` is clean, and the rolling modules
  remain split at 988 and 53 lines. The protected Sketcher VibeScript integration
  returns zero; all 17 protected Part Design phases report `PHASE_OK`, the final
  result contains `"ok": true`, and the wrapper returns zero.
- Driving/Reference Toggle is the twenty-first exact `sketch.constraint`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_ToggleDrivingConstraint` action.
  It does not expose or alter Sketcher's human-controlled global
  driving/reference creation mode. Native accepts a bounded ordered set of one
  through sixteen distinct exact constraint indices, the exact expected state
  of each selected constraint, and all three current Sketch counts. It supports
  every dimensional constraint type handled by the host command: Distance,
  DistanceX, DistanceY, Radius, Diameter, Angle, SnellsLaw, and Weight,
  including inactive and virtual dimensional constraints. Nondimensional
  constraints, stale or duplicate targets, malformed or unbounded arguments,
  external-only references becoming driving, existing solver issues, and
  incomplete, inconsistent, mutating, or refusing diagnostics are rejected
  before mutation.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchDriving.py` is a 272-line atomic transaction domain,
  `SteveCADNativeSketchDrivingState.py` is a 285-line exact state and
  postcondition verifier, and `SteveCADNativeSketchDrivingTarget.py` is a
  101-line exact target parser. The additive Sketcher
  `diagnoseDrivingChanges` API evaluates the complete proposed batch against a
  cloned constraint list, reports exact solver diagnostics, and restores the
  live solver without changing document state. Preflight proves all geometry,
  constraint, external-geometry, expression, and solver state is still exact
  after diagnosis. Mutation uses one named transaction, toggles only the exact
  selected indices, and removes only the selected constraint expression when a
  driving constraint becomes reference. Postconditions prove exact counts,
  geometry topology and metadata, external references, unrelated constraints
  and expressions, each requested driving-state transition, and a clean
  solver. Solver-driven coordinate changes are intentionally accepted because
  making a measured dimensional constraint driving may legitimately solve the
  whole Sketch to new coordinates; exact topology, persistent metadata, and
  constraint state remain protected.
  Forty-three focused Driving/Reference domain tests cover all eight
  dimensional types, mixed batches, inactive, virtual, named, and expressed
  constraints, the sixteen-target bound, every refusal above, exact
  diagnostics, diagnostic side effects, preflight drift, expression record
  shape and path resolution, postcondition drift, solver motion, and exact
  transaction routing. Driving plus the complete geometry and constraint
  schema suites are 118/118 green. The complete Native Sketch suite is
  969/969 green, and the full current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,271/2,271
  green with four intentional skips. The individual Driving schema is exactly
  1,104 bytes; all twenty-one constraint variants serialize to exactly 28,824
  bytes; the thirty geometry plus twenty-one constraint surfaces total 40,742
  bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. Active/Inactive Toggle is now
  the fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle toggles eight exact targets spanning every
  host dimensional type in a thirteen-constraint, ten-geometry Sketch. It
  proves direct diagnosis has no live side effects; stale, nondimensional,
  external-only, redundant-batch, and duplicate calls create no undo entry;
  selection and active edit context remain unchanged; a named expression is
  removed only when its exact constraint becomes reference; the complete
  batch is one semantic undo/redo step; and exact states, metadata,
  expressions, constraints, solver health, and selection survive FCStd
  save/reopen. The accumulated Sketch lifecycle switches to a separate
  human-selected Driving Sketch, freezes a fresh provider turn, replays and
  reopens it after every earlier geometry and constraint case, and reports all
  52 implemented operations ending in
  `constrain_symmetric,constrain_block,constrain_group,toggle_driving_reference`.
  The rebuilt Sketcher and SteveCAD script targets, representative Model bracket
  workflow, and exact 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All twelve checked
  packaged source/build copies are byte-identical, touched Python passes Ruff
  and `python -m compileall`, `git diff --check` is clean, and the rolling
  modules remain split at 995 and 54 lines. The protected Sketcher VibeScript
  integration returns zero; all 17 protected Part Design phases complete, the
  final structured result contains `"ok": true`, and the forced process marker
  is `STEVECAD_PARTDESIGN_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_EXIT 0`.
- Active/Inactive Toggle is the twenty-second exact `sketch.constraint`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_ToggleActiveConstraint` action.
  It accepts the exact human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts,
  and a bounded ordered batch of one through sixteen distinct exact constraint
  indices with each constraint's expected current active state. The desired
  state is the exact inverse because the human command itself is a toggle.
  Native does not impose a stale constraint-type whitelist: the contract and
  runtime support every current or future host constraint category that the
  human command can toggle, while still freezing each selected constraint's
  exact index, type, state, and complete serialized record.
  `SketchObject::diagnoseActiveChanges` validates the whole batch, clones only
  the selected constraints, applies their hypothetical active states and
  orientations to a copied constraint vector, and diagnoses the complete
  hypothetical solver state without mutating the live Sketch. The Python
  binding strictly accepts only one through sixteen integer/boolean pairs,
  returns the exact ordered indices and active states plus bounded solver
  diagnostics, and restores the live solver diagnostics before returning.
  Native refuses stale counts, types, or states; duplicate or unbounded
  targets; existing solver issues; incomplete, inconsistent, or rejected host
  diagnostics; diagnostic side effects; preflight drift; and unrelated
  postcondition changes before committing any result. Mutation uses one named
  host transaction and calls `toggleActive` only for the exact selected
  indices. Postconditions prove exact geometry topology and metadata, external
  references, constraint records, expressions, requested state transitions,
  and clean solver diagnostics. Solver-driven coordinate changes remain
  permitted because either activation or deactivation can legitimately solve
  the Sketch differently without changing its protected topology or metadata.
  Thirty-seven focused Active/Inactive tests cover mixed active/inactive
  batches, the full sixteen-target bound, exact runtime routing, expressions,
  Driving and Virtual flags, solver movement, and Distance, Horizontal,
  Coincident, Block, Group, Text, and InternalAlignment semantic categories,
  along with every refusal and drift condition above. The complete Native
  Sketch suite is 1,008/1,008 green, and the full current `stevecad_tests` sweep
  is 2,310/2,310 green with four intentional skips. The individual Active
  schema is exactly 1,100 bytes; all twenty-two constraint variants serialize
  to exactly 28,914 bytes; the thirty geometry plus twenty-two constraint
  surfaces total 40,832 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. Sketch
  Fillet is now the fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves side-effect-free accepted and rejected
  host diagnoses, redundant-activation refusal, stale and duplicate no-ops,
  unchanged human selection and edit context, exact mixed activation and
  deactivation, a single named undo/redo step, preserved expressions plus
  Driving, Virtual, and Block state, and exact FCStd save/reopen at 91 geometry
  and nine constraints. Its Text fixture follows the complete production
  constructor plus `setTextAndFont` initialization path, so both active and
  inactive Text state are durable. The accumulated lifecycle switches to a
  separate human-selected Active Sketch, freezes a fresh provider turn,
  replays and reopens it after every earlier geometry and constraint case, and
  reports all 52 implemented Sketch mutations ending in
  `constrain_group,toggle_driving_reference,toggle_active_inactive`.
  The sequential Sketcher and SteveCAD script builds, representative Model
  bracket workflow, and exact 527-action live ribbon gate are green. All 18
  checked packaged source/build copies are byte-identical; touched Python
  passes Ruff formatting and lint plus `python -m compileall`;
  `git diff --check` is clean; and the rolling lifecycle is split across
  964-, 75-, and 85-line modules. The protected Sketcher VibeScript integration
  exits zero. All 17 protected Part Design phases report `PHASE_OK`, its final
  structured result contains `"ok": true`, and the forced process marker is
  `STEVECAD_PARTDESIGN_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_EXIT 0`.
- Sketch Fillet is the thirty-first exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_CreateFillet` action. It accepts the exact
  human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts, `preserve_corner`,
  and exactly one of the two target forms exposed by the human command: a
  corner point on one geometry or a bounded pair of geometry indices. It does
  not expose an arbitrary radius. For a corner target, the host derives the
  same initial radius as the task-panel path,
  `min(length1, length2) * 0.2 * sin(angle / 2)`. For a two-curve line/line
  target it uses `Part::suggestFilletRadius`; the other supported bounded
  curve pairs pass zero so the existing Sketcher fillet kernel derives the
  radius. Native uses the human command's `trim=true`, `chamfer=false`
  behavior, preserves the host's untrimmed result for blocked targets, and
  creates the result as construction geometry only when both source
  geometries are construction geometry. It never changes human selection.
  Stale counts, malformed or ambiguous target forms, duplicate or out-of-range
  indices, unsupported geometry, invalid corner points, an already-unhealthy
  solver, incomplete or inconsistent host diagnostics, diagnostic side
  effects, preflight drift, and any postcondition mismatch are refused before
  a result can be retained.
  `SteveCADNativeSketchFillet.py` is a 558-line atomic transaction domain,
  `SteveCADNativeSketchFilletDiagnostic.py` is a 288-line strict diagnostic
  validator, and `SteveCADNativeSketchFilletTarget.py` is a 165-line exact
  target parser. The additive Sketcher `diagnoseFillet` overloads execute the
  existing production fillet implementation against a detached diagnostic
  clone, with a narrowly scoped detached `PropertyConstraintList` mode that
  skips only live ObjectIdentifier rename/removal paths. The diagnostic
  binding returns bounded solver state, exact normalized target and radius,
  trim/construction decisions, and complete detached geometry, metadata, and
  constraint state without opening a document transaction or mutating the
  live Sketch. The final mutation uses one named transaction and the same host
  fillet path. Postconditions prove exact geometry, constraint, and external
  counts; exact retained topology, metadata, expressions, external references,
  and solver health; identity mapping for every pre-existing geometry; unique
  tags for every new geometry; and a complete mutation receipt whose before,
  after, retained, and created index partitions are mutually consistent.
  Malformed geometry-group metadata also fails closed.
  Twenty-seven focused Fillet tests cover both target forms, human radius
  derivation, `preserve_corner`, trimmed and blocked results, construction
  inheritance, exact runtime routing, diagnostic purity, every bounded-input
  refusal, preflight drift, malformed diagnostics and group data, receipt
  integrity, topology changes, solver state, and exact transaction behavior.
  The complete Native Sketch suite is 1,036/1,036 green, and the full current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,338 passed with four intentional skips. The
  individual Fillet schema is exactly 1,732 bytes in the provider's wrapped
  measurement; all thirty-one geometry variants serialize to exactly 13,000
  bytes; all twenty-two constraint variants serialize to 28,914 bytes; and
  the combined geometry and constraint surface is exactly 41,915 bytes
  against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. Sketch Chamfer is now the
  fail-closed surface boundary.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves four resulting geometries, four
  constraints, both exact target forms, side-effect-free diagnostics,
  refusals with no undo entry, unchanged selection and edit context, and one
  semantic undo/redo transaction. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers 53 Sketch operations, inserts `create_fillet` immediately after
  `toggle_construction`, and saves and reopens the shared FCStd document after
  every operation through
  `constrain_group,toggle_driving_reference,toggle_active_inactive`. FreeCAD
  regenerates geometry UUID tags when an FCStd document reopens, so the reopen
  contract correctly proves exact persisted geometry and constraints plus
  nonempty, unique regenerated tags rather than claiming UUID equality across
  serialization. The sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, exact
  527-action live ribbon gate, representative Model bracket workflow, and all
  82 host Sketcher tests are green with one intentional host skip. The
  protected Sketcher VibeScript integration exits zero; all 17 protected Part
  Design VibeScript phases complete, its final structured result contains
  `"ok": true`, and its forced process marker is
  `STEVECAD_PARTDESIGN_VIBESCRIPT_FINAL_EXIT 0`. All fourteen checked
  source/build Python copies are byte-identical; touched Python passes Ruff
  formatting and lint plus `python -m compileall`; `git diff --check` is
  clean. Fillet production modules remain split at 558, 288, and 165 lines,
  its focused tests at 505, 262, and 145 lines, and the shared rolling modules
  remain bounded at 982, 56, and 77 lines.
- Sketch Chamfer is the thirty-second exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_CreateChamfer` action. Its closed contract reuses the
  two exact target forms proved for the human Fillet/Chamfer handler: one
  endpoint corner or two bounded curves with exact reference points. It also
  requires the exact human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts,
  and `preserve_corner`; it does not expose an arbitrary radius. The detached
  host diagnostic executes the existing Sketcher fillet kernel with
  `trim=true,chamfer=true`. It derives the corner and line/line radii through
  the same human paths, leaves the remaining supported bounded curve pairs to
  the kernel, proves the support arc, visible chamfer line, optional preserved
  corner, exact construction state, full detached geometry and constraint
  state, and solver health, and makes no live-document change. The final
  mutation uses one named transaction and preserves the human command's exact
  construction-index behavior, including its preserved-corner edge case,
  rather than silently changing human semantics. Selection and edit context
  remain untouched.
  Stale counts, malformed or ambiguous targets, duplicate or out-of-range
  indices, unsupported or unbounded geometry, invalid corner points, blocked
  source trimming, existing solver problems, incomplete or inconsistent host
  diagnostics, diagnostic side effects, preflight drift, malformed geometry
  groups, receipt corruption, and every postcondition mismatch fail before a
  result is retained. The shared exact-target and exact-state infrastructure
  is isolated in 173- and 466-line modules; the Fillet and Chamfer target
  wrappers are 37 lines each; Fillet production is reduced to 179 lines; and
  Chamfer production and diagnostic validation are split into 205- and
  337-line modules. The rolling GUI orchestration was split before further
  growth and now uses 873- and 65-line runners; the focused Chamfer GUI gate is
  382 lines.
  Thirty-one focused Chamfer tests cover both target forms, radius and
  construction semantics, preserved and consumed corners, exact routing,
  diagnostic purity, stale and malformed inputs, drift, grouping, receipt
  integrity, rollback, solver state, and exact transaction behavior. The
  combined Fillet/Chamfer/schema focused run is 92/92 green, the complete
  Native Sketch suite is 1,068/1,068 green, and the full current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,370 passed with four intentional skips. The
  individual Chamfer schema is exactly 1,733 bytes, all thirty-two geometry
  variants serialize to 13,048 bytes, all twenty-two constraint variants to
  28,916 bytes, and both Sketch schemas total 41,964 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI lifecycle proves both actual mutation target forms,
  five geometries and six constraints for the corner case, four geometries
  and four constraints for the curve-pair case, side-effect-free diagnostics,
  stale refusal with no undo entry, unchanged selection and edit context, one
  transaction per mutation, undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated
  real-GUI lifecycle now covers 54 Sketch operations and saves and reopens the
  shared document after each operation. The sequential SteveCADScripts and
  Sketcher builds, refactored Fillet GUI gate, exact 527-action live ribbon
  census, representative Model bracket workflow, and all 84 host Sketcher
  tests are green with one intentional host skip. The protected Sketcher and
  Part Design VibeScript integrations exit zero, and the latter's structured
  result contains `"ok": true`. All 17 applicable source/build copies are
  byte-identical; the 19 touched Python files pass Ruff formatting and lint
  plus `python -m compileall`; and `git diff --check` is clean. Trim is now the
  deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch Trim is the thirty-third exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Trimming` action. Its closed contract requires the
  exact human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts, one exact
  trim-eligible geometry index, the exact picked point, and the complete
  expected post-mutation state returned by a detached host diagnostic. The
  diagnostic follows the existing human Trim handler's curve and internal-
  geometry eligibility rules, runs the real Sketcher trim kernel on an
  isolated clone, and reports whether the operation deletes, shortens, or
  splits the source curve. It returns the complete resulting geometry,
  construction, constraint, external-geometry, expression, solver, identity,
  and mutation-receipt state without opening a document transaction or
  changing the live Sketch. The final mutation uses one named transaction and
  proves that the original target is replaced or deleted exactly as diagnosed,
  with no guessed topology or relaxed postcondition.
  During real-kernel verification, the split case exposed an important
  discrepancy: a raw detached recompute retained replacement line parameter
  intervals of `[15,20]`, while the human document recompute normalized them
  to `[0,5]`. The implementation was corrected to run the detached clone's
  full `solve(true)` path before publishing expected state. The verifier was
  not weakened; the diagnostic and committed operation now agree on the exact
  normalized result. Stale counts, malformed or ineligible targets, group or
  internal geometry, diagnostic side effects, incomplete diagnostics,
  preflight drift, identity or expression drift, receipt corruption, solver
  failure, and every exact-state mismatch fail before a result is retained.
  Shared mutation receipts, identity, expression, and exact-state helpers were
  extracted into a dedicated module rather than duplicated, and Trim target,
  diagnostic, state, and transaction responsibilities remain split across
  focused modules.
  Thirty-five focused Trim tests cover delete, shorten, split, closed-curve,
  target validation, diagnostic distrust and purity, all eligibility gates,
  stale-state refusal, exact state, receipts, identity, expressions, rollback,
  and runtime routing. The individual Trim schema is exactly 1,190 bytes; all
  thirty-three geometry variants serialize to 13,576 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is
  2,406 passed with four intentional skips.
  Three real-kernel Trim host tests prove delete, shorten, split, and the exact
  normalized split intervals. The complete Sketcher host suite is 87/87 green
  with one intentional skip. The focused real-GUI gate proves all three
  outcomes, exact targets and receipts, side-effect-free diagnostics, stale
  refusal without an undo entry, unchanged selection and edit context, one
  transaction, undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI
  lifecycle now covers 55 Sketch operations and saves and reopens the shared
  document after every operation. Sequential SteveCADScripts, Sketcher, and
  SketcherScripts builds, the exact 527-action live ribbon census, and the
  representative Model bracket workflow are green. The protected Sketcher and
  Part Design VibeScript integrations both exit zero, and the latter's final
  structured result contains `"ok": true`. Split is now the deliberate
  fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch Split is the thirty-fourth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Split` action. Its closed contract requires the exact
  human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts, one exact eligible
  geometry index, the exact picked point, and the complete expected
  post-mutation state returned by an isolated host diagnostic. The diagnostic
  matches the human selection gate for line segments, circles, ellipses, arcs
  of conics, and B-splines; the human B-spline-knot path is represented by its
  resolved parent curve. It runs the real Sketcher split kernel and full
  `solve(true)` path on a detached clone without changing the live document.
  The committed operation then uses one named transaction and must reproduce
  that exact diagnosed geometry, construction, constraint, external-geometry,
  expression, solver, durable-identity, and mutation-receipt state.
  Open curves must become exactly two connected, nondegenerate replacements
  of the correct kind while preserving the source endpoints and construction
  state. Closed and periodic curves must become exactly one open,
  non-periodic replacement. Only the selected curve and any aligned internal
  helpers owned by that curve may be deleted, which preserves the real
  B-spline cleanup behavior without permitting unrelated topology changes.
  Malformed or stale counts, ineligible or internal targets, invalid points,
  diagnostic side effects, incomplete or inconsistent detached results,
  unrelated deletions, wrong replacement kinds or counts, disconnected
  pieces, expression or identity drift, corrupt receipts, solver failure, and
  every exact-state mismatch fail before a result is retained. Shared exact
  curve-point targeting, detached-result parsing, and state verification were
  extracted for Trim and Split instead of duplicating either operation.
  Thirty-one focused Split tests cover open and closed outcomes, every human
  curve family, target bounds, diagnostic distrust and purity, eligibility,
  stale-state refusal, exact geometry and constraint state, expressions,
  identities, receipts, rollback, transaction behavior, and runtime routing.
  The individual Split schema is exactly 1,191 bytes; all thirty-four geometry
  variants serialize to 13,597 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,438 passed with four
  intentional skips.
  Four real-kernel Split host tests prove a line's two normalized connected
  pieces and coincident constraint, closed-circle and closed-ellipse opening,
  every supported open conic-arc and B-spline kind, construction preservation,
  exact receipts, diagnostic purity, and rejection outside the human gate.
  The complete Sketcher host suite is 91/91 green with one intentional skip.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves line splitting and circle opening, exact
  targets and receipts, side-effect-free diagnostics, stale refusal without
  an undo entry, unchanged selection and edit context, one transaction,
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers 56 Sketch operations and saves and reopens the shared document after
  every operation. The exact 527-action live ribbon census and representative
  Model bracket workflow remain green. Both protected VibeScript integrations
  exit zero and the Part Design result contains `"ok": true`. The final
  sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds are green; all 18 applicable
  source/build copies are byte-identical; the 20 touched Python files pass Ruff
  lint, Ruff formatting, and `python -m compileall`; and `git diff --check` is
  clean. Extend is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface
  boundary.
- Sketch Extend is the thirty-fifth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Extend` action. Its closed contract requires the
  exact human-opened Sketch, all three observed Sketch counts, one exact
  eligible geometry index, an explicit `start | end` endpoint, and the exact
  picked target point. It exposes no inferred endpoint, curve search, raw
  increment, solver control, command dispatch, or workbench activation. The
  eligibility gate matches the human command exactly: only a line segment or
  circular arc may be extended, internal geometry is excluded, the target must
  move the selected endpoint, and the line handler's human endpoint-switch
  behavior is refused instead of silently changing the caller's exact role.
  A shared native calculation now drives both the live drawing preview and a
  detached `diagnoseExtend` path. The diagnostic clones the Sketch, runs the
  real `extend` kernel and `solve(true)`, and returns exact geometry,
  construction, constraint, solver, identity, expression, and mutation-receipt
  state without opening a document transaction or changing the live Sketch.
  The committed operation accepts only that frozen result, rechecks the exact
  live state before mutation, performs one named transaction, and retains a
  concise result containing the exact target, selected endpoint, extended or
  shortened outcome, new endpoint, changed geometry indices, and final counts.
  Malformed or stale counts, ineligible geometry, endpoint switching, no-op or
  arc-center targets, incomplete or malicious diagnostics, diagnostic side
  effects, unrelated constrained-geometry changes, collection-identity drift,
  changed constraints or expressions, post-preflight drift, receipt
  corruption, and every exact postcondition mismatch fail before a result is
  retained.
  Real-GUI verification exposed a pre-existing host defect in circular-arc
  Extend: the arc range was mutated through a raw geometry pointer, so the
  named document transaction existed but Undo did not restore the arc. The
  shared Sketcher kernel now clones the arc, changes the clone's range, and
  replaces the `Geometry` property value. This records the mutation through
  the document property system for both the human command and Native mode,
  while preserving geometry identity and the historical endpoint calculation.
  A permanent host regression proves exact circular-arc undo and redo.
  Forty-five focused Extend tests cover the closed target, all four line/arc
  extension and shortening outcomes, untrusted diagnostics and purity,
  eligibility, stale-state refusal, exact geometry and constraint state,
  identities, expressions, receipts, rollback, and runtime routing. The
  individual Extend schema is exactly 1,249 bytes; all thirty-five geometry
  variants serialize to 14,078 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,484 passed with four
  intentional skips. Five focused real-kernel Extend host tests prove line and
  circular-arc endpoints and directions, construction preservation, exact
  receipts, diagnostic purity, endpoint-switch refusal, unsupported-target
  refusal, and document undo/redo. The complete Sketcher host suite is 96/96
  green with one intentional skip.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves line extension and arc shortening, exact
  targets and receipts, side-effect-free diagnostics, stale refusal without an
  undo entry, unchanged selection and edit context, one transaction, exact
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers 57 Sketch operations in one shared editable document and verifies the
  durable state after save/reopen. The exact 527-action live ribbon census and
  representative Model bracket workflow remain green. Both protected
  VibeScript integrations exit zero and the Part Design result contains
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds are green;
  all 15 applicable source/build copies are byte-identical; the 16 focused
  Python files pass Ruff lint, Ruff formatting, and `python -m compileall`; and
  `git diff --check` is clean. External-geometry Projection is now the
  deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch external-geometry Projection is the thirty-sixth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_Projection`
  action. Its closed contract requires the exact human-opened Sketch, all
  three observed Sketch counts, the exact source object and optional exact
  `Face`, `Edge`, or `Vertex` subelement, an explicit defining/reference role,
  and the complete expected external-reference state. It also supports the
  same whole-object Datum, Plane, Line, and Point sources as the human command.
  It exposes no object search, inferred role, UI-preference inference, raw
  external index, command dispatch, or workbench activation.
  Sketcher now has an additive, side-effect-free `diagnoseExternal` host API.
  Diagnosis and committed external-geometry rebuild both use one shared
  projection evaluator, so preflight does not approximate the kernel or clone
  a live document graph. The diagnostic resolves stable mapped-topology keys
  through the same topological-naming path as the committed
  `PropertyLinkSubList`, and reports the projected geometry, durable reference,
  external type, reference index, add/upgrade outcome, and defining role.
  Native mode performs that diagnosis before mutation and repeats it against
  the exact frozen state immediately before one named transaction. It then
  calls the real `addExternal` path and verifies exact geometry, constraints,
  external links and types, solver state, durable identities, source geometry
  and placement, and mutation receipt before retaining the result.
  Duplicate Projection/Both links, invalid or self targets, stale counts,
  source geometry/configuration drift, diagnostic side effects or inconsistent
  metadata, unexpected external-type padding, wrong mapped references,
  collection-identity drift, solver failure, receipt corruption, and every
  exact postcondition mismatch fail without a retained mutation. An existing
  Intersection link may be upgraded to Both only while preserving its explicit
  defining/reference role. The source fingerprint deliberately covers
  projection-relevant geometry and placement rather than reverse-link metadata,
  allowing the expected Sketch backlink while still rejecting source changes.
  The aligned external-state decoder also distinguishes real link/type records
  from Sketcher's historical blank-Sketch `ExternalTypes == [0]` padding; a
  permanent host regression freezes that behavior.
  The focused Projection/schema suite has 83 passing tests. The individual
  Projection schema is exactly 1,460 bytes; all thirty-six geometry variants
  serialize to 14,911 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The complete
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,530 passed with four intentional skips.
  Nine focused real-kernel host tests prove defining and reference projections,
  mapped compound keys, Edge/Vertex/Face targets, duplicate and invalid-state
  refusal, role-preserving Intersection-to-Both upgrade, diagnostic purity,
  exact commit agreement, and document undo/redo.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves exact selection and edit context,
  side-effect-free diagnosis, stale and duplicate refusal, one transaction,
  exact undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. It also proves that both Projection
  and Intersection remain present on the human ribbon while the production
  Native surface returns no schemas because the next Intersection variant is
  incomplete. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers 58 Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies the durable state
  after save/reopen. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  integrations exit zero; the final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher
  builds, focused Ruff check, and `git diff --check` are green. External-
  geometry Intersection is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry`
  surface boundary.
- Sketch external-geometry Intersection is the thirty-seventh exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_Intersection`
  action. It uses the same exact human-opened Sketch, source object,
  `Face`/`Edge`/`Vertex` subelement, explicit defining/reference role, observed
  Sketch counts, and complete expected external-reference state as Projection;
  it exposes no object search, inferred role, raw external index, command
  dispatch, workbench activation, or UI-preference inference. Projection and
  Intersection now share one small production transaction core while retaining
  separate operation contracts and wrappers. Both paths diagnose twice around
  preflight, perform exactly one real `addExternal` call in one named document
  transaction, and verify exact source state, projected geometry, constraints,
  external links and types, solver state, durable identities, receipt, and
  operation outcome before retaining a mutation.
  A new Intersection creates type 1; applying Intersection to an existing
  Projection upgrades it to Both/type 2 while preserving the user's explicit
  defining/reference role. Applying Projection to an existing Intersection
  remains the complementary role-preserving upgrade. Exact duplicates,
  mismatched expected state, stale source or Sketch counts, impure, untrusted,
  incomplete, or drifting diagnostics, postcondition drift, and receipt
  corruption all fail closed without retaining a result.
  Real-GUI verification exposed a host wrapper defect for crossing-edge
  Intersection points: `Part::GeomPoint::getPyObject()` reconstructed a bare
  point and discarded its `ExternalGeometryExtension`. It now returns a clone,
  matching the curve wrappers and preserving the durable reference, external
  type, and defining/reference role. Permanent Projection and Intersection
  host regressions freeze the point-wrapper behavior.
  The focused schema/Projection/Intersection suite has 104 passing tests. The
  individual Intersection schema is exactly 1,462 bytes; all thirty-seven
  geometry variants serialize to 14,998 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap. The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,551 passed
  with four intentional skips. Five focused Intersection host tests and the
  complete 110-test Sketcher host suite pass with one intentional skip. The
  focused real-GUI gate proves crossing-edge point creation, explicit reference
  role, diagnostic purity, stale and duplicate refusal, exact receipt and
  result, selection/edit-context preservation, one transaction, exact
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers 59 Sketch operations in one shared editable document and verifies the
  durable state after save/reopen. It also proves Projection and Intersection
  remain present on the human ribbon while Native fails closed at Carbon Copy.
  Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript integrations exit zero.
  Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, focused Ruff lint and
  formatting, and `git diff --check` are green, and no GUI process remains.
  Carbon Copy is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface
  boundary.
- Sketch Carbon Copy is the thirty-eighth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and
  maps only the live `Sketcher_CarbonCopy` action. Its closed request names the
  exact active target Sketch and exact source Sketch, freezes their geometry,
  constraint, external-geometry, expression, placement, container, and solver
  state, and requires the observed source and target counts. The request makes
  the geometry role explicit as `regular` or `construction` and makes the
  source relationship explicit as same-body aligned, cross-body aligned, or
  unaligned. Those three modes map directly to the host's two independent
  cross-body and alignment permission flags; Native does not infer them from
  GUI preferences, selection, or document layout.
  Sketcher now exposes an additive exact Carbon Copy host API and a detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path that shares the real transformation,
  constraint, solver, external-reference, and expression construction logic
  with the commit. The human command retains its existing preference-driven
  behavior. Native diagnoses the exact operation twice around a complete
  frozen-state comparison, commits once in one named transaction, and proves
  exact created indices and tags, copied geometry and construction roles,
  constraints, projected external references, source-linked expressions,
  alignment flips, solver health, stable unrelated state, and the concise
  mutation receipt. Generated geometry tags are normalized only in the
  repeatability and save/reopen comparisons because detached diagnoses and
  reopened documents legitimately allocate fresh tags; the actual committed
  receipt still proves every real created tag exactly.
  Missing or detached sources, source/target identity drift, stale counts,
  duplicate or circular copies, unavailable or synchronizing external
  geometry, forbidden cross-body or unaligned relationships, impure,
  incomplete, untrusted, or drifting diagnostics, malformed expression paths,
  postcondition drift, and receipt corruption all fail without a retained
  mutation. Source geometry, constraints, external references, expressions,
  placement, and solver state are proved unchanged after commit, undo/redo,
  and save/reopen.
  Seven focused real-kernel host tests cover pure diagnosis and exact commit,
  regular and construction geometry, external references, expressions,
  explicit unaligned transforms and flips, explicit cross-body permission,
  invalid/duplicate/circular refusal, and undo/redo; the independent reverse-
  mapping host regression also passes. The focused Native Carbon Copy suite is
  15/15 green, its schema/Carbon/snapshot group is 59/59 green, all Native
  Sketch tests are 1,266/1,266 green, all Native tests are 1,889/1,889 green,
  and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,568 passed with four
  intentional skips. The individual Carbon Copy schema is exactly 1,818 bytes
  and all thirty-eight geometry variants serialize to 16,066 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves diagnostic purity, stale and duplicate
  refusal, exact external-reference and expression copying, one transaction,
  exact undo/redo, source preservation, selection preservation, and FCStd
  save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers 60 Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies durable state after
  save/reopen. It also proves Carbon Copy and Translate remain on the human
  ribbon while production Native fails closed at the unfinished Translate
  action. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript integrations exit
  zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, focused Ruff lint
  and formatting, and `git diff --check` are green. The read-only 5-axis crash
  fixture remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Translate is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface
  boundary.
- Sketch Translate is the thirty-ninth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Translate` action. Its closed request names the exact
  active Sketch, ordered unique internal or external geometry indices, observed
  geometry, constraint, and external-geometry counts, the exact first vector,
  copy count, optional exact second vector and row count, and the explicit
  `Preserve` or `Equal` dimensional-constraint mode. It rejects ambiguous row
  configuration, a zero first vector, unsupported axes or incomplete internal
  geometry, `Equal` in move mode, and requests that would create more than
  4,096 geometry elements.
  Sketcher now exposes one additive exact Translate host API and a detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path. The existing human preview remains intact,
  while its final commit and Native share the same exact mutation
  implementation. Move mode preserves expression-driven dimensional
  constraints. Copy and two-vector array modes preserve construction state,
  supported curve geometry, external-geometry semantics, copied constraints,
  internal alignment, and the ribbon's exact ordering; `Equal` mode constrains
  copied dimensional constraints to their originals. The host diagnostic and
  receipt now include exact geometry and constraint tags, making stable object
  identity directly verifiable rather than inferred from array position.
  Native freezes exact geometry, constraint, external-reference, expression,
  configuration, solver, and durable-tag state; diagnoses twice around
  preflight; proves diagnosis purity and repeatability; commits exactly once in
  one named transaction; and verifies the complete final state and concise
  receipt. Stale counts or identities, untrusted, incomplete, impure, or
  drifting diagnostics, malformed receipt echoes, and any geometry,
  constraint, expression, solver, or tag drift fail closed without retaining a
  mutation.
  Seven focused real-kernel host tests cover pure move diagnosis, expression
  preservation, construction and supported curves, one- and two-vector arrays,
  dimensional equality, external geometry, invalid or incomplete input, and
  exact undo/redo. The focused Native Translate suite is 21/21 green; its
  schema and adjacent operation group is 62/62 green; all Native Sketch tests
  are 1,288/1,288 green; all Native tests are 1,911/1,911 green; and the
  complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,590 passed with four intentional
  skips. The individual Translate schema is exactly 1,793 bytes and all
  thirty-nine geometry variants serialize to 17,107 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves pure exact host diagnosis, stale refusal,
  expression-preserving move, arbitrary two-vector two-dimensional array,
  exact generated geometry and constraints, stable identities, one
  transaction, exact undo/redo, and durable FCStd save/reopen state. The
  accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers 61 Sketch operations in one shared
  editable document and verifies durable state after save/reopen. It also
  proves Translate and Rotate remain on the human ribbon while production
  Native fails closed at the unfinished Rotate action. Both protected Sketcher
  and Part Design VibeScript integrations exit zero. Final sequential
  SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, focused Ruff lint and formatting, the
  seven-test real-host rerun, and `git diff --check` are green; no FreeCAD
  process remains. The read-only 5-axis crash fixture was never modified and
  remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Rotate is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch Rotate is the fortieth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only
  the live `Sketcher_Rotate` action. Its closed request names the exact active
  Sketch, ordered unique internal or external geometry indices, observed
  geometry, constraint, and external-geometry counts, an explicit center,
  degree-valued total angle, copy count, and `Preserve` or `Equal`
  dimensional-constraint mode. It rejects a zero or out-of-range angle,
  `Equal` in move mode, unsupported axes or incomplete internal geometry, and
  requests that would create more than 4,096 geometry elements.
  Sketcher now exposes one additive exact Rotate host API and a detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path. The existing human preview remains intact,
  while its final commit and Native share the same exact mutation
  implementation. Move mode replaces the selected geometry and preserves
  expression-driven dimensional constraints. Copy mode retains the originals,
  distributes copies across the requested total angle, preserves construction
  state, supported curve geometry, external-geometry semantics, copied
  constraints, and internal alignment, and implements the ribbon's exact
  `Preserve` and `Equal` behavior. Axis-dependent horizontal, vertical,
  distance-X, and distance-Y constraints are intentionally not copied onto
  rotated geometry, matching the human command.
  Native freezes exact geometry, constraint, external-reference, expression,
  configuration, solver, and durable-tag state; diagnoses twice around
  preflight; proves diagnosis purity and repeatability; commits exactly once in
  one named transaction; and verifies the complete final state and concise
  receipt. Stale counts or identities, untrusted, incomplete, impure, or
  drifting diagnostics, malformed receipt echoes, and any geometry,
  constraint, expression, solver, or tag drift fail closed without retaining a
  mutation.
  Seven focused real-kernel host tests cover expression-preserving move,
  angular copy distribution, dimensional equality, axis-dependent constraint
  semantics, external geometry, invalid-input purity, and exact undo/redo. The
  focused Native Rotate suite is 21/21 green; its schema and adjacent operation
  group is 84/84 green; all Native Sketch tests are 1,310/1,310 green; all
  Native tests are 1,933/1,933 green; and the complete current `stevecad_tests`
  sweep is 2,612 passed with four intentional skips. The individual Rotate
  schema is exactly 1,680 bytes and all forty geometry variants serialize to
  17,539 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves pure exact host diagnosis, stale refusal,
  expression-preserving move, exact polar-array geometry and constraints,
  stable identities, one transaction, exact undo/redo, and durable FCStd
  save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers 62 Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies durable state after
  save/reopen. It also proves Translate, Rotate, and Scale remain on the human
  ribbon while production Native fails closed at the unfinished Scale action.
  Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript integrations exit zero.
  Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, an explicit SketcherGui
  build, focused Ruff lint and formatting, the seven-test real-host rerun, and
  `git diff --check` are green; no FreeCAD process remains. The implementation
  is split across bounded modules (the shared host transform file is 672 lines
  and the shared Native transform-state module is 515 lines). The read-only
  5-axis crash fixture was never modified and remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Scale is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch Scale is the forty-first exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only
  the live `Sketcher_Scale` action. Its closed request names the exact active
  Sketch, ordered unique internal or external geometry indices, observed
  geometry, constraint, and external-geometry counts, an explicit center, a
  finite positive bounded scale factor, and explicit copy-versus-replace
  intent. It rejects duplicate or stale targets, axes, incomplete aligned
  internal geometry, and factors outside the bounded schema. Native does not
  expose the human command's special whole-sketch origin mode.
  Sketcher now exposes one additive exact Scale host API and one detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path. The existing human preview remains intact,
  while its final commit and Native share the same exact mutation
  implementation. Uniform scaling covers points, lines, circles, circular
  arcs, ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, and B-splines; preserves construction
  state, external-geometry semantics, internal alignment, dimensional
  constraints, constraint-label locations, and the source facade ID during
  replacement; and follows the human command's expression semantics. Copy mode
  retains the source state and creates the scaled geometry and constraints in
  the ribbon's exact ordering.
  Native freezes exact geometry, constraint, external-reference, expression,
  configuration, solver, and durable-identity state; diagnoses twice around
  preflight; proves diagnosis purity and repeatability; commits exactly once in
  one named transaction; and verifies the complete final state and concise
  receipt. Stale state, untrusted, incomplete, impure, or drifting diagnostics,
  malformed receipt echoes, and any postcondition drift fail closed without
  retaining a mutation.
  Eight focused real-kernel host tests cover replacement and copy semantics,
  dimensional and orientation constraints, all supported curve families,
  external geometry, invalid-input purity, guarded whole-sketch origin mode,
  and exact undo/redo. The focused Native Scale suite is 21/21 green; its
  Translate/Rotate/Scale/schema group is 106/106 green; all Native Sketch tests
  are 1,332/1,332 green; all Native tests are 1,955/1,955 green; and the
  complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,634 passed with four intentional
  skips. The individual Scale schema is exactly 1,428 bytes and all forty-one
  geometry variants serialize to 17,852 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves pure diagnosis, stale refusal, exact circle
  replacement and line copying, constraint and expression semantics, stable
  identities, one transaction, exact undo/redo, selection preservation, and
  durable FCStd save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers 63 Sketch operations in one shared editable document and verifies
  durable state after save/reopen. It also proves Translate, Rotate, Scale, and
  Offset remain on the human ribbon while production Native fails closed at
  unfinished Offset. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  integrations exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds,
  an explicit SketcherGui build, focused Ruff lint, the eight-test real-host
  rerun, and `git diff --check` are green; no FreeCAD process remains. The
  Scale implementation is split across bounded host, target, state, runtime,
  GUI-case, integration, and test modules, each below 1,000 lines.
  The SteveCAD nested-link preselection fix was also verified against a
  byte-identical disposable copy of the real 5-axis machine by scanning its
  viewport with mouse preselection and resolving nested App::Link subelements;
  the regression exits normally, the upstream `TestViewProviderLink` suite is
  5/5 green, and the original read-only fixture was never saved or modified and
  remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Offset is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Sketch Offset is the forty-second exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Offset` action. Its closed request names the exact
  active Sketch, ordered unique internal or external geometry indices,
  observed geometry, constraint, and external-geometry counts, a signed,
  finite, nonzero bounded offset distance in millimetres, the exact Arc or
  Intersection join type, and explicit Keep, Delete, or Constrain source
  behavior. Duplicate or stale targets, unsupported geometry, incomplete
  aligned internal geometry, mixed or invalid topology, invalid enum values,
  and distances outside the bounded schema fail closed before mutation.
  Sketcher now exposes one additive exact Offset host API and one detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path. The human command retains its interactive
  preview, while its final commit and Native share the same exact mutation
  implementation. Internal and external lines, circles, and circular arcs are
  supported in the Sketch working plane; Arc and Intersection joins, source
  retention or deletion, construction connectors, topology constraints, and
  one shared driving offset dimension follow the human ribbon semantics.
  Native freezes exact geometry, constraint, external-reference, expression,
  configuration, solver, and durable-identity state; diagnoses twice around
  preflight; proves diagnosis purity and repeatability; commits exactly once in
  one named transaction; and verifies the complete final state, identities,
  and concise receipt. Only the presentation-computed label distance and label
  position of newly created dimensions are normalized between detached and
  live state; all semantic constraint fields remain exact and a changed
  dimension value is proven to fail verification. Stale state, untrusted,
  incomplete, impure, or drifting diagnostics, malformed receipt echoes, and
  any semantic postcondition drift fail closed without retaining a mutation.
  Ten focused real-kernel host tests cover pure diagnosis/commit parity,
  positive and negative signed offsets, Arc and Intersection joins, Keep,
  Delete, and Constrain modes, polygon and circle constraints, existing
  constraints, external geometry, invalid-input purity, and exact undo/redo.
  The focused Native Offset suite is 17/17 green; its adjacent
  Translate/Rotate/Scale/Offset/schema group is 123/123 green; all Native
  Sketch tests are 1,350/1,350 green; all Native tests are 1,973/1,973 green;
  and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,652 passed with four
  intentional skips. The individual Offset schema is exactly 1,530 bytes and
  all forty-two geometry variants serialize to 18,482 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves signed circle offset, both join modes, all
  three source modes, pure diagnosis, stale refusal, stable identities, one
  transaction, exact undo/redo, selection preservation, and durable FCStd
  save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers 64 Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies durable state after
  save/reopen. At the rolling document's bounded undo capacity, the gate
  verifies the exact latest transaction name and actual undo/redo state while
  permitting eviction of the oldest entry. It also proves Symmetry remains on
  the human ribbon while production Native fails closed at unfinished
  `Sketcher_Symmetry`. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  integrations exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds,
  an explicit SketcherGui build, focused Ruff lint and formatting, the
  ten-test real-host rerun, and `git diff --check` are green; no FreeCAD process
  remains. The Offset implementation is split across bounded host, constraint,
  target, state, runtime, GUI-case, integration, and test modules, each below
  1,000 lines. The original read-only 5-axis fixture was never saved or
  modified and remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Symmetry is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface
  boundary.
- Sketch Symmetry is the forty-third exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_Symmetry` action. Its closed request names the exact
  active Sketch, ordered unique internal or external source geometry indices,
  observed geometry, constraint, external-reference, and external-geometry
  counts, one exact line, axis, origin, or geometry-point reference, and
  explicit Keep, Delete, or Constrain source behavior. Duplicate or stale
  targets, axes or the origin as sources, unsupported geometry, incomplete
  aligned internal geometry, invalid reference positions, non-line whole
  references, invalid enum values, and drifting exact state fail closed before
  mutation.
  Sketcher now exposes one additive exact Symmetry host API and one detached,
  side-effect-free diagnostic path. The human command retains its interactive
  preview, while its final commit and Native share the same exact mutation
  implementation. Points, lines, circles, circular arcs, ellipses, elliptical,
  hyperbolic, and parabolic arcs, and B-splines can be mirrored about an exact
  internal or external line, either Sketch axis, the origin, or an exact
  supported geometry point. Construction state, external-geometry semantics,
  internal alignment, copied constraints, curve orientation, source deletion,
  and optional editable human Symmetric constraints follow the human ribbon
  semantics.
  Native freezes exact geometry, constraint, external-reference, expression,
  configuration, solver, and durable-identity state; diagnoses twice around
  preflight; proves diagnosis purity and repeatability; commits exactly once in
  one named transaction; and verifies the complete final state, identities,
  exact reference and mode echoes, and concise receipt. Stale state, untrusted,
  incomplete, impure, or drifting diagnostics, malformed receipt echoes, and
  any postcondition drift fail closed without retaining a mutation.
  Nine focused real-kernel host tests cover pure diagnosis/commit parity,
  horizontal and vertical axes, internal and external line references, origin
  and exact geometry-point references, all three source modes, every human
  curve family, copied constraints, expression removal, curve orientation,
  invalid-input purity, strict integer parsing, and exact undo/redo. The
  focused Native Symmetry suite is 17/17 green; its adjacent
  Translate/Rotate/Scale/Offset/Symmetry/schema group is 142/142 green; all
  Native Sketch tests are 1,368/1,368 green; all Native tests are 1,991/1,991
  green; and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,670 passed with
  four intentional skips. The individual Symmetry schema is exactly 1,435
  bytes and all forty-three geometry variants serialize to 18,954 bytes
  against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves internal-line, vertical-axis, origin-point,
  and external-line references; Keep, Delete, and Constrain behavior; pure
  diagnosis; stale refusal; copied constraints and expression semantics; one
  transaction; exact undo/redo; selection and edit-context preservation; and
  durable FCStd save/reopen state. The preceding focused Offset gate remains
  green, and the accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now covers all 65 implemented
  Sketch operations in one shared editable document and verifies durable state
  after save/reopen. It also proves removal of axis alignment remains on the
  human ribbon while production Native fails closed at unfinished
  `Sketcher_RemoveAxesAlignment`. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design
  VibeScript integrations exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts and
  Sketcher builds, an explicit SketcherGui build, focused Ruff lint and
  formatting, the nine-test real-host rerun, and `git diff --check` are green;
  no FreeCAD process remains. The Symmetry implementation is split across
  bounded host, target, state, runtime, GUI-case, integration, and test modules,
  each no longer than 551 lines. The original read-only 5-axis fixture was
  never saved or modified and remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Removal of axis alignment is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- Remove Axes Alignment is the forty-fourth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only the live `Sketcher_RemoveAxesAlignment` action. Its closed
  request names the exact active Sketch, 1–256 ordered unique current internal
  geometry indices, and observed geometry, constraint, external-reference,
  and external-geometry counts. Axes, external geometry, duplicates, stale
  indices or counts, empty selections, and selections with no applicable
  rewrite fail closed before mutation; no raw selection path or command
  dispatch is exposed.
  Sketcher now exposes additive exact and detached-diagnostic host APIs over
  the same rewrite used by the existing human command. Whole-line Horizontal
  and Vertical constraints are removed while additional selected constraints
  of each orientation become Parallel to the first; selected axis-based
  Symmetric and PointOnObject relationships are removed; selected DistanceX
  and DistanceY constraints become general Distance constraints without
  changing their durable tag, name, expression, or value; point-specific
  Horizontal/Vertical constraints, non-axis PointOnObject relations, and
  unselected alignment remain unchanged. The existing permissive human API
  retains its public no-op behavior, while the exact Native path rejects a
  no-op and strict Python target parsing rejects booleans.
  Native freezes complete geometry, constraint, external-reference,
  expression, configuration, solver, and durable-identity state. It derives
  the only valid rewrite independently from the frozen records, validates all
  six diagnostic counts and the complete expected final constraint sequence,
  proves detached-diagnosis purity, diagnoses again immediately before
  commit, commits once in one named transaction, and verifies complete final
  state plus the host mutation receipt. An incomplete, untrusted, impure, or
  drifting diagnostic, unrelated geometry or external-state change, wrong
  constraint rewrite, stale target, or semantic postcondition drift fails
  closed without retaining a mutation.
  Seven focused real-host tests cover Horizontal/Vertical-to-Parallel
  rewriting, axis Symmetric and PointOnObject removal, distance conversion
  with expression/tag preservation, point-specific and non-axis preservation,
  unselected preservation, strict invalid/no-op purity, legacy no-op behavior,
  and exact undo/redo. The focused Native suite is 14/14 green; the adjacent
  Translate/Rotate/Scale/Offset/Symmetry/Remove-Axes-Alignment/schema group is
  157/157 green; all Native Sketch tests are 1,383/1,383 green; all Native
  tests are 2,006/2,006 green; and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep
  is 2,685 passed with four intentional skips. The individual schema is
  exactly 1,068 bytes, all forty-four geometry variants serialize to 19,165
  bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap, and the preceding forty-three
  variants remain exactly 18,954 bytes.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves every rewrite family, pure diagnosis,
  stale and no-op refusal with no transaction, stable distance identity/name/
  expression, one successful transaction, exact undo/redo, selection and edit
  preservation, and durable FCStd save/reopen state. The preceding focused
  Symmetry gate remains green, and the accumulated real-GUI lifecycle now
  covers all 66 implemented Sketch operations in one shared editable document
  and verifies every separate operation Sketch after save/reopen. Production
  Native still exposes zero tools and now fails closed at unfinished
  `Sketcher_BSplineConvertToNURBS`.
  The nested-link selection fix was additionally rerun directly against the
  original read-only 5-axis machine: all eligible nested linked-Body faces
  resolve through `getDetailPath`, a real mouse-move sweep exercises the
  `SoFCUnifiedSelection` preselection path from the reported crash, and the GUI
  exits cleanly. The file was never saved or repaired and remains exactly
  SHA-256 `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript integrations exit zero.
  Final sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds, an explicit SketcherGui
  build, focused Ruff lint/formatting, `git diff --check`, line-size checks,
  and process cleanup are green. The new host, target, state, runtime,
  GUI-case, integration, and test modules are each below 500 lines. B-spline
  conversion to NURBS is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry`
  surface boundary.
- B-spline conversion to NURBS is the forty-fifth exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_BSplineConvertToNURBS` action. Its
  closed request names the exact active Sketch, 1–256 ordered unique current
  internal or external edge indices, and observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts. Empty selections, axes,
  points, duplicates, stale indices or counts, grouped/internal-alignment
  geometry, unhealthy external state, and resource-excessive B-spline helper
  expansion fail closed before mutation; no raw selection path or command
  dispatch is exposed.
  Sketcher now exposes additive `diagnoseConvertToNURBS(list[int])` and
  `convertToNURBSExact(list[int])` host APIs while retaining the existing
  public `convertToNURBS(int)` behavior. Detached clone preflight validates the
  complete ordered mixed internal/external conversion before live mutation,
  closing the human helper's legacy partial-mutation failure path. Commit
  preserves the command's two-pass behavior: all requested roots convert in
  selection order, then only converted internal roots expose control points and
  knots; external targets become internal B-spline copies without helper
  exposure. Placement, tolerance, tags, expressions, external references and
  maps, solver state, and exact constraint deletion/remapping semantics are
  covered by the diagnostic and mutation receipt.
  Native independently freezes and verifies complete geometry, constraint,
  external, expression, solver, configuration, and durable-identity state. It
  proves exact root ordering and B-spline types, exact helper geometry and
  InternalAlignment/Weight/Equal constraints, expected endpoint-Coincident
  survival and midpoint/non-Coincident removal, external-copy behavior,
  detached-diagnosis purity, immediate pre-commit freshness, one named
  transaction, and the complete postcondition. Untrusted or drifting
  diagnostics, unexpected helper/resource growth, unrelated state changes, or
  wrong host receipts fail closed without retaining a mutation.
  Seven focused real-host tests are registered through Sketcher's aggregate
  test entry point and cover internal, external, mixed-order, constraint,
  expression, invalid-target purity, legacy API, and exact undo/redo behavior.
  The focused Native/schema suite is 18/18 green; all Native Sketch tests are
  1,401/1,401 green; all Native tests are 2,024/2,024 green; and the complete
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,703 passed with four intentional skips.
  The individual schema is exactly 1,093 bytes and all forty-five geometry
  variants serialize to 19,357 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves mixed internal/external conversion, controls,
  knots, constraints, expression removal, stale/point refusal, one undo/redo,
  save/reopen, selection, and edit-context preservation. The accumulated
  real-GUI lifecycle covers all 67 implemented Sketch operations in one shared
  editable document and verifies durable state after save/reopen. Both
  protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final
  sequential SteveCADScripts and Sketcher builds and the explicit SketcherGui
  build are green. All row modules are below 500 lines. The original read-only
  5-axis fixture was never saved or modified and remains byte-identical at
  SHA-256 `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline degree increase is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- B-spline degree increase is the forty-sixth exact `sketch.geometry` variant
  and maps only the live `Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseDegree` action. Its closed
  request names the exact active Sketch, 1–256 ordered unique current internal
  B-spline geometry indices, and observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts. Empty selections, axes,
  points, external or grouped geometry, duplicate or stale indices/counts,
  non-B-splines, degree-25 curves, unhealthy solver/external state, excessive
  helper growth, and any ambiguous or non-applicable target fail closed before
  mutation; no raw selection path or command dispatch is exposed.
  Sketcher now exposes additive `diagnoseIncreaseBSplineDegree(list[int])` and
  `increaseBSplineDegreeExact(list[int])` host APIs while retaining the
  existing public API and human-command behavior. The exact path clones each
  complete Part geometry object, elevates its degree exactly once in detached
  preflight, and then replaces the live root and exposes only missing control
  points and knots. This avoids the legacy raw-OCC reconstruction path and
  preserves construction state, durable tags, expressions, placement,
  tolerance, external state, and unaffected geometry/constraint identity and
  order.
  Native freezes the complete geometry, constraint, external, expression,
  solver, configuration, and durable-identity state; computes an independent
  curve proof containing degree, poles, weights, knots, multiplicities,
  periodic/rational/closed flags, parameter range, and nine shape samples;
  proves detached-diagnosis purity; diagnoses again immediately before
  commit; commits once in one named transaction; and verifies the complete
  host receipt and postcondition. Degree must increase by exactly one, knot
  multiplicities by exactly one, knots/range/flags and sampled shape must stay
  invariant, pole growth is bounded, pre-existing helpers may move only to the
  exact elevated control/knot positions without changing identity or metadata,
  and every newly appended helper/constraint must have the exact construction
  and InternalAlignment/Weight/Equal semantics. Untrusted, impure, stale, or
  drifting diagnostics and unrelated-state changes fail closed without
  retaining a mutation.
  Seven focused real-host tests are registered through Sketcher's aggregate
  entry point and cover unexposed and already-exposed B-splines, exact degree
  elevation and shape preservation, helper/constraint behavior, metadata and
  expression identity, invalid/maximum-degree purity, legacy behavior, and
  exact undo/redo. The focused Native/schema suite is 21/21 green; the
  complete geometry-schema group is 50/50 green; all Native Sketch tests are
  1,420/1,420 green; all Native tests are 2,043/2,043 green; and the complete
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,722 passed with four intentional skips.
  The individual schema is exactly 1,070 bytes and all forty-six geometry
  variants serialize to 19,432 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves degree/shape/identity preservation,
  existing and created helper semantics, constraints and expressions,
  maximum-degree and stale-target refusal, one undo/redo, selection and edit
  preservation, and durable FCStd save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI
  lifecycle covers all 68 implemented Sketch operations in one shared editable
  document and verifies every separate operation Sketch after save/reopen.
  Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero.
  Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and explicit
  SketcherGui builds are green; focused Ruff lint/format checks and
  `git diff --check` are green. The installed clang-format 18.1.3 cannot parse
  the repository configuration's `BreakTemplateDeclarations` key, so no false
  C++ formatting-pass claim is recorded. Every new row module is below 500
  lines. No SteveCAD/FreeCAD process remains, the retired generated
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py` artifact is absent, and the original read-only
  5-axis fixture was never saved or modified and remains byte-identical at
  SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline degree decrease is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- B-spline degree decrease is the forty-seventh exact `sketch.geometry`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseDegree` action. Its
  closed request names one exact current internal B-spline geometry index, the
  exact active Sketch, all observed geometry, constraint, external-reference,
  and external-geometry counts, and an explicit finite
  `maximum_deviation_mm`. Lists, booleans, axes, external/grouped geometry,
  non-B-splines, degree-one curves, stale counts or indices, unhealthy
  solver/external state, malformed helper alignment, custom constraints or
  expressions on disposable helpers, excessive helper growth, and any
  approximation above the requested loss limit fail closed before mutation.
  The normal result is concise: the exact root index, old and new degrees,
  measured deviation, retained-helper count, and created/deleted geometry and
  constraint counts.
  Sketcher now exposes additive `diagnoseDecreaseBSplineDegree(int)` and
  `decreaseBSplineDegreeExact(int)` host APIs while retaining the existing
  public `decreaseBSplineDegree(int, int)` behavior. Detached diagnosis clones
  the complete Part geometry, applies the human command's one-degree-lower OCC
  approximation, preserves the root object and its metadata, matches existing
  control/knot helpers by exact position, remaps retained InternalAlignment
  indices, deletes only obsolete helpers and their generated constraints, and
  exposes the complete reduced helper set. The exact commit preserves the root
  index, root tag, construction/layer metadata, unrelated geometry,
  constraints, names, expressions, placement, tolerance, and external state.
  Seven focused real-host tests cover pure diagnosis, the actual lossy
  cubic-to-quadratic approximation, exposed-helper reconciliation, unrelated
  expression identity, malformed alignment, invalid targets, the legacy API,
  and exact undo/redo.
  Native freezes and verifies the complete transform state and independently
  proves degree, poles, weights, knots, multiplicities, periodic/rational/
  closed flags, parameter range, and 129 sampled positions. It computes a
  parameterization-independent symmetric sampled-polyline deviation, diagnoses
  again immediately before commit, runs one named transaction, and verifies
  the complete mutation receipt, reduced representation, deviation, helper
  positions and roles, alignment indices, solver state, and all unrelated
  records. UUIDs for newly created diagnostic-clone helpers are correctly
  treated as commit-time identities and canonicalized only for created entries;
  every pre-existing geometry and constraint identity remains exact. This
  closes real clone-to-clone UUID nondeterminism without weakening final-state
  or receipt verification.
  The focused Native/schema suite is 21/21 green, the complete geometry-schema
  group is 52/52 green, all Native Sketch tests are 1,441/1,441 green, all
  Native tests are 2,064/2,064 green, and the complete current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,743 passed with four intentional skips. The
  individual schema is exactly 1,088 bytes and all forty-seven geometry
  variants serialize to 19,804 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves explicit loss-limit refusal, degree and root
  identity, helper deletion/creation and alignment, unrelated named-expression
  preservation, stale/non-spline/linear-spline refusal, one undo/redo,
  selection and edit-context preservation, and durable FCStd save/reopen state.
  The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle covers all 69 implemented Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies every separate
  operation Sketch after save/reopen. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design
  VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts,
  SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and explicit SketcherGui builds are green; focused
  Ruff lint/format checks and `git diff --check` are green. Every row module is
  below 500 lines. No SteveCAD/FreeCAD process remains, the retired generated
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py` artifact is absent, and the original 5-axis
  fixture passed a final read-only GUI hover/preselection regression without
  being saved or modified; its SHA-256 remains
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline knot-multiplicity increase is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- B-spline knot-multiplicity increase is the forty-eighth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplineIncreaseKnotMultiplicity` child action. Its closed request
  names the exact active Sketch, all observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts, one exact current internal
  B-spline geometry index, and one exact zero-based knot index. Lists,
  booleans, axes, external/grouped geometry, non-splines, stale counts or
  indices, end knots already at maximum multiplicity, unhealthy solver or
  external state, malformed/duplicate helper alignment, custom helper
  constraints, excessive helper growth, and any sampled shape displacement
  above 0.001 mm fail closed before mutation. The normal result is concise:
  the root geometry index, knot index and parameter, degree, old and new
  multiplicities, and retained, deleted, and exposed helper counts.
  Sketcher now exposes additive
  `diagnoseIncreaseBSplineKnotMultiplicity(int, int)` and
  `increaseBSplineKnotMultiplicityExact(int, int)` host APIs while retaining
  the existing public OCC-indexed `modifyBSplineKnotMultiplicity` behavior.
  Detached diagnosis clones the complete Sketch state, increases exactly one
  internally converted one-based OCC knot multiplicity by one, preserves the
  root geometry object, durable identity, and metadata, maps existing control
  and knot helpers by exact position, removes only obsolete generated helpers,
  and exposes the complete resulting helper set. The exact commit preserves
  unrelated geometry, constraints, names, expressions, placement, tolerance,
  external state, and root index, identity, construction, and layer metadata.
  Seven focused real-host tests cover diagnosis purity, exact commit,
  root/construction identity, complete helper reconciliation, unrelated
  expression and constraint preservation, invalid geometry and knot targets,
  maximum multiplicity, malformed duplicate alignment, the legacy API, and
  one-step undo/redo.
  Native freezes and verifies the complete transform state and independently
  proves degree, poles, weights, knots, multiplicities, periodic/rational/
  closed flags, parameter range, and 129 pointwise shape samples. It diagnoses
  again immediately before commit, runs one named transaction, and verifies
  the complete mutation receipt, exactly one multiplicity increment, exactly
  one added pole, unchanged knot vector/domain/representation flags, the hard
  0.001 mm sampled-displacement ceiling, helper positions and roles, alignment
  indices, solver state, and every unrelated record. UUID canonicalization is
  limited to helpers created by detached diagnosis; all pre-existing geometry
  and constraint identities remain exact. The focused operation/schema plus
  degree-decrease and geometry-schema regression set is 82/82 green; all
  Native Sketch tests are 1,456/1,456 green; all Native tests are
  2,079/2,079 green; and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,758
  passed with four intentional skips. The individual schema is exactly 1,079
  bytes and all forty-eight geometry variants serialize to 20,124 bytes
  against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves stale-count, wrong-geometry, out-of-range,
  and maximum-endpoint refusal; detached-diagnosis purity; exact
  multiplicity, root identity, sampled shape, helper, constraint, and
  expression state; selection and edit-context preservation; one undo/redo;
  and durable FCStd save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle
  covers all 70 implemented Sketch operations in one shared editable document
  and verifies every separate operation Sketch after save/reopen. Both
  protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final
  sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and explicit
  SketcherGui builds are green; focused Ruff lint/format checks and
  `git diff --check` are green. Every row module is below 500 lines. The
  degree-decrease helper state was cleanly generalized for both B-spline
  mutations, with no stale source reference or generated build copy. No
  SteveCAD/FreeCAD process remains, the retired generated
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py` artifact is absent, and the original read-only
  5-axis fixture was never saved or modified and remains byte-identical at
  SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline knot-multiplicity decrease is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- B-spline knot-multiplicity decrease is the forty-ninth exact
  `sketch.geometry` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplineDecreaseKnotMultiplicity` child action. Its closed request
  names the exact active Sketch, all observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts, one exact current internal
  B-spline geometry index, one exact zero-based knot index, and an explicit
  finite `maximum_deviation_mm`. Lists, booleans, axes, external/grouped
  geometry, non-splines, stale counts or indices, out-of-range knots,
  unhealthy solver or external state, malformed/duplicate helper alignment,
  custom constraints or expressions on disposable helpers, excessive helper
  growth, kernel-refused endpoint removal, and any approximation above the
  requested loss limit fail closed before mutation. The normal result is
  concise: the root geometry index, knot index and parameter, degree, old and
  new multiplicities, measured deviation, and retained, deleted, and exposed
  helper counts.
  Sketcher now exposes additive
  `diagnoseDecreaseBSplineKnotMultiplicity(int, int)` and
  `decreaseBSplineKnotMultiplicityExact(int, int)` host APIs while retaining
  the existing public OCC-indexed `modifyBSplineKnotMultiplicity` behavior.
  Increase and decrease share one exact host kernel without changing the human
  command path. Detached diagnosis clones the complete Sketch state and applies
  exactly one decrement: a higher-multiplicity knot remains with multiplicity
  reduced by one, while a multiplicity-one interior knot is removed using the
  human command's OCC tolerance. The root geometry object, durable identity,
  and metadata are preserved; existing control and knot helpers are matched by
  exact position, only obsolete generated helpers are removed, retained
  InternalAlignment indices are remapped, and every missing helper in the
  reduced representation is exposed. Unrelated geometry, constraints, names,
  expressions, placement, tolerance, external state, and root index,
  construction, layer, and durable identity remain exact. Eight focused
  real-host tests cover detached-diagnosis purity, actual positive-loss
  interior-knot removal, retained higher-multiplicity knots, complete helper
  reconciliation, root/construction identity, unrelated constraint and
  expression identity, invalid types and targets, malformed duplicate
  alignment, kernel-refused endpoint purity, the legacy API, and exact
  undo/redo.
  Native freezes and verifies the complete transform state and independently
  proves degree, poles, weights, knots, multiplicities, periodic/rational/
  closed flags, parameter range, and 129 sampled positions. Loss is computed
  with a parameterization-independent symmetric sampled-polyline deviation.
  Native diagnoses again immediately before commit, runs one named
  transaction, and verifies the complete host receipt, retained-knot or
  removed-knot representation semantics, the explicit loss limit, helper
  positions and roles, alignment indices, solver state, and every unrelated
  record. Detached-clone UUID canonicalization remains limited to newly created
  helpers; every pre-existing geometry and constraint identity stays exact.
  Shared representation-proof, mutation-state, and helper-reconciliation
  modules serve both multiplicity directions, avoiding a duplicated state
  monolith; every row module is below 500 lines.
  The focused increase/decrease/schema plus degree-decrease and
  geometry-schema regression set is 97/97 green; all Native Sketch tests are
  1,471/1,471 green; all Native tests are 2,094/2,094 green; and the complete
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,773 passed with four intentional skips.
  The individual schema is exactly 1,173 bytes and all forty-nine geometry
  variants serialize to 20,404 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves stale-count, zero-loss-limit,
  kernel-refused endpoint, non-spline, and out-of-range refusal;
  detached-diagnosis purity; actual positive-loss knot removal within the
  explicit limit; root, helper, constraint, expression, selection, and
  edit-context identity; one undo/redo; and durable FCStd save/reopen state.
  The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle covers all 71 implemented Sketch
  operations in one shared editable document and verifies every separate
  operation Sketch after save/reopen. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design
  VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts,
  SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and explicit SketcherGui builds are green; focused
  Ruff lint/format checks and `git diff --check` are green. No SteveCAD/FreeCAD
  process remains; the old multiplicity-increase source filenames, their stale
  generated build copy, the retired generated `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py`, and
  the earlier degree-decrease helper artifact are absent. The protected 5-axis
  fixture was never saved or modified and remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline knot insertion is now the deliberate fail-closed
  `sketch.geometry` surface boundary.
- B-spline knot insertion is the fiftieth exact `sketch.geometry` variant and
  maps only the live `Sketcher_BSplineInsertKnot` child action. Its closed
  request names the exact active Sketch, all observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts, one exact current internal
  B-spline geometry index, and one explicit finite parameter. Booleans,
  non-finite or billion-scale values, stale counts, external or grouped
  geometry, non-splines, parameters outside the actual curve domain, knots
  already at maximum multiplicity, unhealthy solver or external state,
  malformed or duplicate helper alignment, custom constraints or expressions
  on disposable helpers, and excessive helper growth all fail closed before
  mutation. The concise result reports the root geometry index, requested and
  resolved knot parameters, degree, old and new multiplicities, sampled
  displacement, and retained, deleted, and exposed helper counts.
  Sketcher now exposes additive `diagnoseInsertBSplineKnot(int, double)` and
  `insertBSplineKnotExact(int, double)` host APIs while retaining the existing
  public `insertBSplineKnot(int, double, int)` API and human command path.
  Detached diagnosis clones the complete Sketch and external state. Exact
  commit applies the same OCC insertion primitive as the human action: a new
  parameter creates exactly one knot with multiplicity one, while an existing
  knot gains exactly one multiplicity. Both cases add exactly one control pole,
  preserve degree and curve shape, retain the root geometry object, durable
  identity, construction state, and metadata, and use the shared host helper
  reconciler to retain exact-position helpers, delete only obsolete generated
  helpers, remap InternalAlignment indices, and expose only missing helpers.
  Unrelated geometry, constraints, names, expressions, placement, tolerance,
  and external state remain exact. Seven real-host tests cover new and existing
  knot semantics, detached-diagnosis purity, helper and expression identity,
  invalid finite/domain/type/geometry targets, maximum endpoint refusal,
  duplicate alignment, the legacy API, and exact undo/redo.
  Native freezes and verifies the complete transformation state, diagnoses
  again immediately before commit, performs one named transaction, and proves
  the exact host receipt, new-knot or existing-knot representation, unchanged
  degree, parameter domain and representation flags, exactly one added pole,
  root and unrelated-record identity, helper reconciliation, solver health,
  and 129 pointwise curve samples under the hard 0.001 mm displacement ceiling.
  Detached-clone UUID canonicalization remains limited to newly created
  helpers. The individual schema is exactly 1,075 bytes and all fifty geometry
  variants serialize to 20,690 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused B-spline/schema regression set is 112/112 green; all Native
  Sketch tests are 1,486/1,486 green; all Native tests are 2,109/2,109 green;
  and the complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,788 passed with four
  intentional skips.
  The focused real-GUI gate proves stale-count, before-domain, after-domain,
  non-spline, and maximum-endpoint refusal; detached-diagnosis purity; exact
  insertion shape, root, helper, constraint, expression, selection, and edit
  state; one undo/redo; and durable FCStd save/reopen state. The accumulated
  real-GUI lifecycle covers all 72 implemented Sketch operations and verifies
  every separate operation Sketch after one shared save/reopen. Both protected
  Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final sequential
  SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds are green;
  focused Ruff checks and `git diff --check` are clean. Every row module is
  below 500 lines. The old multiplicity-increase source/build artifacts, the
  earlier degree-decrease helper artifact, and retired generated
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py` remain absent; no SteveCAD/FreeCAD process remains.
  The protected 5-axis fixture was never saved or modified and remains
  byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Curve joining is now the deliberate fail-closed `sketch.geometry` surface
  boundary.
- Curve joining is the fifty-first exact `sketch.geometry` variant and maps
  only the live `Sketcher_JoinCurves` child action. Its closed request names
  the exact active Sketch, all observed geometry, constraint,
  external-reference, and external-geometry counts, and two distinct exact
  internal curve endpoints expressed only as `start` or `end`. The assistant
  cannot request a continuity level: Native and the host derive C0 or C1 from
  the same exact endpoint Tangent constraint inspected by the human command.
  Stale counts, axes or external geometry, duplicate curves, whole-curve or
  non-endpoint targets, points, closed or periodic curves, internal helper
  geometry, grouped/Text members, mixed construction state, unhealthy solver
  or external state, excessive helper growth, malformed receipts, duplicate
  or missing helper roles, and any detached/live result disagreement fail
  closed. The concise result reports both requested endpoints, derived C0/C1
  continuity, the joined B-spline index and representation, exact deleted and
  created geometry indices, and the generated helper count.
  Sketcher now exposes additive
  `diagnoseJoinCurves(int, PointPos, int, PointPos)` and
  `joinCurvesExact(int, PointPos, int, PointPos)` host APIs while retaining the
  existing public `join(...)` API and human command. Diagnosis clones the
  complete Sketch state, runs the same join primitive on the clone, bounds the
  resulting geometry, and solves it without touching the live document. Exact
  commit repeats that preflight before applying the shared primitive. The
  shared C1 path now safely elevates degree-one inputs to degree two before
  forming the interior join knot and rejects a zero endpoint derivative,
  fixing the prior invalid zero-multiplicity tangent join without changing C0
  behavior. Seven real-host tests prove pure detached C0/C1 diagnosis, endpoint
  reversal, valid joining when both source B-splines already expose their
  generated helpers, invalid-target refusal, unrelated named expression and
  durable identity preservation, legacy API availability, and one exact
  undo/redo transaction.
  Native freezes the complete geometry, constraint, expression, external,
  solver, placement, and tolerance state; diagnoses again immediately before
  commit; and performs one named document transaction. Its independent proof
  requires both selected roots and only their aligned helpers to be deleted,
  every unrelated geometry and constraint to retain its identity, exactly one
  open non-periodic B-spline root, its endpoints to equal the two unselected
  source endpoints in the requested orientation, and exactly one unique
  `InternalAlignmentIndex` for every control pole and knot helper. Final
  verification compares the complete canonical host state, exact mutation
  receipt, remapped expressions, external records, solver degrees of freedom,
  and configuration token to the frozen diagnostic plan.
  The focused Native/schema set is 20/20 green; all Native Sketch tests are
  1,506/1,506 green; all Native tests are 2,129/2,129 green; and the complete
  current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,808 passed with four intentional skips.
  The individual schema is exactly 1,374 bytes and all fifty-one geometry
  variants serialize to 21,324 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  The focused compiled real-GUI gate proves stale-count, duplicate-curve, and
  invalid-endpoint refusal; detached-diagnosis purity; exact C0 B-spline and
  complete helper topology; unrelated named expression and identity
  preservation; one undo/redo; unchanged selection/edit boundary; and durable
  FCStd save/reopen state. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle covers all 73
  implemented Sketch operations in one long-lived document and verifies every
  separate operation Sketch after the shared save/reopen cycle. Both protected
  Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero. Final sequential
  SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds are green;
  focused Ruff format/lint checks and `git diff --check` are clean. The row's
  host and Native implementation modules range from 100 to 366 lines. No
  SteveCAD/FreeCAD process remains, and the retired generated
  `SteveCADWorkbenchTools.py` stays absent from source and build output. The
  protected 5-axis fixture was never opened for mutation, saved, or modified
  and remains byte-identical at SHA-256
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Constraint-based element selection is now the deliberate fail-closed Sketch
  surface boundary.
- Constraint-based element selection is the first exact `sketch.inspect`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_SelectConstraints` action. It is a
  primary read with `transaction_behavior="none"`: the assistant supplies one
  exact active Sketch, observed geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts,
  and 1–32 distinct internal, external, axis, whole-geometry, or exact-point
  selections. The operation does not call the GUI selection API and does not
  reproduce the human command's selection side effect. Instead it returns the
  current matching constraint indices, types, optional names, per-constraint
  matched-selection indices, bounded counts, and canonical geometry and
  constraint state hashes.
  The implementation freezes complete geometry, constraint, expression,
  external-geometry, solver, and full `Constraint.Elements` relationship
  state before the read and repeats the freeze afterward. It mirrors the
  human command's `involvesGeoId` semantics for whole geometry and
  `involvesGeoIdAndPosId` semantics for exact points, including Group members
  beyond the first three legacy slots, internal helpers, axes, and external
  geometry. It recognizes only the host's exact `(-2000, 0)` undefined-slot
  padding and rejects malformed references, unavailable points, duplicate or
  stale selections, missing/detached/unsynchronized external geometry,
  non-unique live constraint identities, relationship/resource overflow, or
  any state drift during the read.
  Twenty-four focused domain/schema tests are green. The focused compiled GUI
  gate proves whole, endpoint, and multi-element reads; stale-count refusal;
  exact parity with the human `Sketcher_SelectConstraints` result; unchanged
  human selection, edit/ribbon/workbench boundary, transaction state, undo
  history, and document state; and durable relationship state after FCStd
  save/reopen. The accumulated real-GUI lifecycle is green for all 74
  implemented Sketch operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch
  after one shared save/reopen. The individual provider schema is 1,291 bytes
  and the complete three-tool rolling Sketch schema is 51,529 bytes against
  the unchanged 65,536-byte limit. The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep
  is 2,832 passed with four intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and
  Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero with the final Part Design
  result reporting `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts,
  SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds are green; the row's nine
  implementation/test modules range from 42 to 360 lines. The upstream
  `TestViewProviderLink` suite is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis machine was
  opened only as a read-only regression fixture: nested linked-Body detail
  resolution and a real mouse-move preselection sweep both exit cleanly, and
  its before/after SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  Element-associated constraint selection
  (`Sketcher_SelectElementsAssociatedWithConstraints`) is now the deliberate
  fail-closed Sketch surface boundary.
- Element-associated constraint selection is the second and completing
  `sketch.inspect` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_SelectElementsAssociatedWithConstraints` action through the
  explicit `select_elements` operation. Its closed request names the exact
  active Sketch, observed geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts, and
  1–32 distinct constraints by current index, exact type, and exact name. It
  returns the selected constraint summaries, every ordered unique associated
  whole geometry or exact point, per-element matching input indices, bounded
  counts, and canonical geometry and constraint state hashes. It is a primary
  read with no document transaction and never changes the human GUI selection.
  The operation shares bounded exact element and full relationship-state
  modules with `select_constraints`, rejects stale indices/types/names/counts,
  malformed or overflowing relationships, unavailable points or axes,
  missing/detached/unsynchronized external geometry, non-unique live
  constraint identities, and any state drift during the read. It reads the
  complete bounded `Constraint.Elements` relationship rather than truncating
  to legacy `First`/`Second`/`Third` fields. The real host proves why this
  matters: for a Group with a handle and three members, the stock human
  command selects only the handle, while Native reports the handle and all
  three members without mutating the document or GUI selection.
  Twenty-three new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the
  combined `sketch.inspect` set to 47/47. The focused compiled GUI gate proves
  both relationship directions, ordinary whole/point/multi-selection parity,
  exact stale refusal, full Group relationships, unchanged
  selection/edit/ribbon/workbench/transaction/undo state, and durable FCStd
  save/reopen state. The accumulated rolling GUI lifecycle passes all 75
  implemented Sketch operations, including both inspect variants, and
  verifies every separate operation Sketch after the shared save/reopen. The
  `select_elements` provider schema is 1,213 bytes, the combined inspect schema
  is 2,002 bytes, and the complete three-tool rolling Sketch schema is 52,240
  bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. The complete current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,855 passed with four intentional skips. Both
  protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript lifecycles exit zero, with the
  final Part Design result reporting `"ok": true`. Final sequential
  SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds are green;
  focused Ruff lint/format checks and `git diff --check` are clean. Shared and
  reverse inspect implementation modules are split from 61 to 242 lines, and
  the real-GUI case remains 344 lines. The upstream `TestViewProviderLink`
  suite is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis machine was used only as an immutable
  crash-regression fixture: nested linked-Body detail resolution and a real
  mouse-move preselection sweep exit cleanly, and its before/after SHA-256
  remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  `Sketcher_ArcOverlay` in the unfinished `sketch.presentation` family is now
  the deliberate fail-closed Sketch surface boundary.
- Circular arc helper visibility is now the first `sketch.presentation`
  variant and maps only `Sketcher_ArcOverlay` through the explicit
  `arc_overlay` operation. Its closed request names the exact human-opened
  Sketch, observed geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts, the expected
  current visibility, and the desired visibility. The operation is an
  idempotent primary view/presentation action: it changes the global Sketcher
  `ArcCircleHelperVisible` presentation preference without opening a document
  transaction, creating an undo entry, changing selection, or mutating FCStd
  state. It follows the renderer's actual absent-key default of hidden instead
  of the stock toggle command's inconsistent absent-key assumption.
  The runtime freezes complete canonical internal geometry, constraints, and
  external geometry before the preference write and verifies the identical
  state afterward. It rejects a stale preference or count, wrong active
  document/surface/edit target, malformed request, failed host write, or any
  model drift. A no-op performs no preference write. A failed verification
  restores the prior value only while the preference still equals the value
  Native wrote, so an intervening human change is not overwritten; a host
  write that changes the value and then raises is covered by the same
  rollback rule. Success returns only the exact Sketch reference, prior and
  current visibility, changed status, internal/external arc counts, bounded
  Sketch counts, and canonical geometry/constraint/external-state hashes.
  Sixteen focused domain/schema cases are green. The focused compiled GUI
  gate creates two real circular arcs and proves the actual
  `InformationGroup` `SoSwitch` nodes transition hidden to visible under
  Native, the human `Sketcher_ArcOverlay` command produces the matching inverse
  state, stale and no-op behavior is exact, edit/ribbon/workbench/selection/
  transaction/undo/document state is unchanged, and FCStd save/reopen retains
  the model. The gate snapshots and restores the user's exact global
  preference state, including key absence. The accumulated rolling GUI
  lifecycle passes all 76 implemented Sketch operations and verifies every
  separate operation Sketch after the shared save/reopen. The arc-overlay
  schema is 882 bytes and the complete four-tool rolling Sketch schema is
  53,121 bytes against the unchanged 65,536-byte cap. Production remains
  deliberately unavailable because later `sketch.presentation` actions are
  still incomplete; the family is now reported as incomplete rather than
  missing.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,871 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero, with the final Part Design result reporting
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher,
  and SketcherGui builds are green; focused Ruff lint/format checks and
  `git diff --check` are clean. New production modules range from 44 to 190
  lines and the focused GUI modules from 175 to 215 lines. The upstream
  `TestViewProviderLink` suite is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis machine was
  opened only as an immutable crash-regression fixture: nested linked-Body
  detail resolution and a real mouse-move preselection sweep exit cleanly,
  and its before/after SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  B-spline degree-information visibility in row 10.78 is now the deliberate
  fail-closed Sketch surface boundary.
- B-spline degree-information visibility is now the second
  `sketch.presentation` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplineDegree` action through the explicit `bspline_degree`
  operation. Its closed request names the exact human-opened Sketch, observed
  geometry/constraint/external-geometry counts, expected current visibility,
  and desired visibility. The operation uses Sketcher's exact
  `BSplineDegreeVisible` presentation preference and the renderer's actual
  absent-key default of visible. It is an idempotent primary view action: it
  opens no document transaction, creates no undo entry, changes no selection,
  and mutates no FCStd state.
  A shared bounded preference engine now freezes canonical internal geometry,
  constraints, and external geometry before any write, rejects stale counts or
  visibility, verifies the identical Sketch state afterward, and returns only
  the exact Sketch reference, prior/current visibility, changed status,
  internal/external B-spline counts, bounded Sketch counts, and three canonical
  state hashes. A no-op performs no write. Failed verification restores only a
  value still owned by the Native operation; a concurrent human preference
  change is never overwritten, and a host write that mutates then raises is
  rolled back through the same rule.
  Sixteen new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the combined
  presentation set to 32/32. The focused compiled GUI gate creates a real cubic
  B-spline and proves the actual degree-label `InformationGroup` `SoSwitch`
  transitions visible to hidden under Native, the human
  `Sketcher_BSplineDegree` command produces the matching inverse state, stale
  and no-op behavior is exact, edit/ribbon/workbench/selection/transaction/undo
  state remains unchanged, and FCStd save/reopen retains the model. The gate
  snapshots and restores the user's exact global preference state, including
  key absence. The accumulated rolling GUI lifecycle passes all 77 implemented
  Sketch operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch after the
  shared save/reopen. The dedicated provider schema is 885 bytes and the
  complete four-tool rolling Sketch schema is 53,348 bytes against the
  unchanged 65,536-byte cap. Production remains deliberately unavailable
  because later `sketch.presentation` actions are incomplete; B-spline
  control-polygon visibility in row 10.79 is now the fail-closed boundary.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,887 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero, with the final Part Design result reporting
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher,
  and SketcherGui builds are green; focused Ruff lint/format checks and
  `git diff --check` are clean. New production modules remain between 73 and
  204 lines and the focused GUI modules between 98 and 175 lines.
- B-spline control-polygon visibility is now the third
  `sketch.presentation` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplinePolygon` action through the explicit
  `bspline_control_polygon` operation. Its closed request retains the exact
  active-Sketch identity, bounded geometry/constraint/external-geometry
  counts, expected current visibility, and explicit desired visibility. The
  operation uses Sketcher's exact `BSplineControlPolygonVisible` preference
  and the renderer's real absent-key default of visible. It changes no FCStd
  state, document transaction, undo record, edit boundary, or selection.
  A new 61-line shared B-spline presentation adapter now owns the concise
  B-spline result contract for degree and control-polygon state without
  changing the existing degree entry points. The control-polygon operation is
  50 lines and delegates the already-proven stale detection, no-op behavior,
  owned-value rollback, concurrent-human-change protection, and canonical
  Sketch verification to the common preference engine.
  Thirteen new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the combined
  presentation set to 45/45. The focused compiled GUI gate creates the real
  cubic B-spline and identifies the control-polygon layer by its actual four
  pole coordinates, one four-vertex `SoLineSet`, and the renderer's exact
  `zInfo = 0.004` placement. It proves only that layer's `SoSwitch` changes,
  matches the human `Sketcher_BSplinePolygon` command, rejects stale state,
  verifies the no-op path, restores the user's exact global preference
  state—including key absence—and preserves model/edit/ribbon/workbench/
  selection/transaction/undo state through FCStd save/reopen. The prior
  B-spline degree GUI lifecycle remains green after the shared-adapter
  extraction.
  The logged accumulated GUI lifecycle passes all 78 implemented Sketch
  operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch after the shared
  save/reopen. The dedicated control-polygon schema is 894 bytes, the combined
  three-operation presentation schema is 1,184 bytes, and the complete
  four-tool rolling Sketch schema is 53,423 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap. Production remains deliberately unavailable because the
  later `sketch.presentation` actions are incomplete; B-spline
  curvature-comb visibility in row 10.80 is now the fail-closed boundary.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,900 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts,
  Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds are green; focused Ruff lint/format checks
  and `git diff --check` are clean. The upstream `TestViewProviderLink` suite
  remains 5/5 green. The original 5-axis file was never saved or repaired and
  its SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  A fresh post-build GUI regression opened only a byte-identical disposable
  copy, found 29 links, exercised four representative linked objects through
  eight explicit `Face1`/`Edge1` preselection calls and 35 real viewport mouse
  moves, then closed normally without a SIGSEGV. Both original and disposable
  copy retained the exact hash, and no SteveCAD process remains.
- B-spline curvature-comb visibility is now the fourth
  `sketch.presentation` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplineComb` action through the explicit
  `bspline_curvature_comb` operation. Its closed request retains the exact
  active-Sketch identity, bounded geometry/constraint/external-geometry
  counts, expected current visibility, and explicit desired visibility. The
  operation uses Sketcher's exact `BSplineCombVisible` preference and the
  renderer's real absent-key default of visible. It delegates stale-state
  detection, idempotent no-op behavior, owned-value rollback,
  concurrent-human-change protection, and canonical Sketch verification to
  the shared presentation engine and concise B-spline adapter. It changes no
  FCStd state, document transaction, undo record, edit boundary, or
  selection.
  Thirteen new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the combined
  presentation set to 58/58. The focused compiled GUI gate creates a real
  one-piece cubic B-spline and validates the renderer's actual curvature-comb
  topology: 64 radial two-point line records plus one 64-point spine, 192
  coordinates total, radial endpoints identical to the spine coordinates,
  nonzero curvature scale, and exact `zInfo = 0.004` placement. It proves only
  that layer's `SoSwitch` changes, matches the human `Sketcher_BSplineComb`
  command, rejects stale state, verifies the no-op path, restores the user's
  exact global preference state—including key absence—and preserves model/
  edit/ribbon/workbench/selection/transaction/undo state through FCStd
  save/reopen. The prior control-polygon and degree-information GUI lifecycles
  remain green.
  The logged accumulated GUI lifecycle passes all 79 implemented Sketch
  operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch after the shared
  save/reopen. The dedicated curvature-comb schema is 893 bytes, the combined
  four-operation presentation schema is 1,256 bytes, and the complete
  four-tool rolling Sketch schema is 53,495 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap. Production remains deliberately unavailable because later
  `sketch.presentation` actions are incomplete; B-spline knot-multiplicity
  visibility in row 10.81 is now the fail-closed boundary.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,913 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero, with the final Part Design result reporting
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher,
  and SketcherGui builds are green; the upstream `TestViewProviderLink` suite
  is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis file was never saved or repaired and its
  SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  A fresh post-build GUI regression opened only a byte-identical disposable
  copy, found 29 links, exercised four representative linked objects through
  eight explicit `Face1`/`Edge1` preselection calls and 35 real viewport mouse
  moves, then closed normally without a SIGSEGV. Independent before/after
  hashes for the original and disposable copy remained exact, and no SteveCAD
  process remains.
- B-spline knot-multiplicity visibility is now the fifth
  `sketch.presentation` variant and maps only the live
  `Sketcher_BSplineKnotMultiplicity` action through the explicit
  `bspline_knot_multiplicity` operation. Its closed request retains the exact
  active-Sketch identity, bounded geometry/constraint/external-geometry
  counts, expected current visibility, and explicit desired visibility. The
  operation uses Sketcher's exact `BSplineKnotMultiplicityVisible` preference
  and the renderer's real absent-key default of visible. It delegates
  stale-state detection, idempotent no-op behavior, owned-value rollback,
  concurrent-human-change protection, and canonical Sketch verification to
  the shared presentation engine and concise B-spline adapter. It changes no
  FCStd state, document transaction, undo record, edit boundary, or
  selection.
  Thirteen new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the combined
  presentation set to 71/71. A pre-implementation live-host probe and the
  focused compiled GUI gate both establish the renderer's exact topology for
  the one-piece cubic fixture: two independent text switches, each containing
  `Material`, `Font`, `Translation`, and `Text2`; exact labels `(4)` and `(4)`;
  endpoint translations `(-12, -3, 0.004)` and `(14, 2, 0.004)`; knots
  `(0.0, 1.0)`; and multiplicities `(4, 4)`. The focused gate proves only
  those switches change, matches the human `Sketcher_BSplineKnotMultiplicity`
  command, rejects stale state, verifies the no-op path, restores the user's
  exact global preference state—including key absence—and preserves model/
  edit/ribbon/workbench/selection/transaction/undo state through FCStd
  save/reopen. The prior curvature-comb, control-polygon, and
  degree-information GUI lifecycles remain green.
  The logged accumulated GUI lifecycle passes all 80 implemented Sketch
  operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch after the shared
  save/reopen. The dedicated knot-label schema is 896 bytes, the combined
  five-operation presentation schema is 1,337 bytes, and the complete
  four-tool rolling Sketch schema is 53,576 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap. Production remains deliberately unavailable because later
  `sketch.presentation` actions are incomplete; B-spline pole-weight
  visibility in row 10.82 is now the fail-closed boundary.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,926 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero, with the final Part Design result reporting
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher,
  and SketcherGui builds are green; the upstream `TestViewProviderLink` suite
  is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis file was never saved or repaired and its
  SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  A fresh post-build GUI regression opened only a byte-identical disposable
  copy, found 29 links, exercised four representative linked objects through
  eight explicit `Face1`/`Edge1` preselection calls and 35 real viewport mouse
  moves, then closed normally without a SIGSEGV. Independent before/after
  hashes for the original and disposable copy remained exact, the temporary
  copy was moved to Trash, and no SteveCAD process remains.
- B-spline pole-weight visibility is now the sixth `sketch.presentation`
  variant and maps only the live `Sketcher_BSplinePoleWeight` action through
  the explicit `bspline_pole_weight` operation. Its closed request retains the
  exact active-Sketch identity, bounded geometry/constraint/external-geometry
  counts, expected current visibility, and explicit desired visibility. The
  operation uses Sketcher's exact `BSplinePoleWeightVisible` preference and
  the renderer's real absent-key default of visible. It delegates stale-state
  detection, idempotent no-op behavior, owned-value rollback,
  concurrent-human-change protection, and canonical Sketch verification to
  the shared presentation engine and concise B-spline adapter. It changes no
  FCStd state, document transaction, undo record, edit boundary, or selection.
  Thirteen new focused domain/schema cases are green, bringing the combined
  presentation set to 84/84. A pre-implementation live-host probe established
  the renderer's exact per-pole topology: one text switch for each pole, each
  containing `Material`, `Font`, `Translation`, and `Text2`; the first text
  line is empty, the second is the current weight enclosed in brackets, and
  each label is translated to its exact pole coordinate at `zInfo = 0.004`.
  The focused compiled GUI gate uses nonuniform cubic weights and verifies the
  displayed values against Sketcher's canonical current weights at the
  renderer's active display precision. It proves only those switches change,
  matches the human `Sketcher_BSplinePoleWeight` command, rejects stale state,
  verifies the no-op path, restores the user's exact global preference
  state—including key absence—and preserves model/edit/ribbon/workbench/
  selection/transaction/undo state through FCStd save/reopen. The prior
  knot-multiplicity, curvature-comb, control-polygon, and degree-information
  GUI lifecycles remain green.
  The logged accumulated GUI lifecycle passes all 81 implemented Sketch
  operations and verifies every separate operation Sketch after the shared
  save/reopen. The dedicated pole-weight schema is 890 bytes, the combined
  six-operation presentation schema is 1,400 bytes, and the complete
  four-tool rolling Sketch schema is 53,639 bytes against the unchanged
  65,536-byte cap. Production remains deliberately unavailable because later
  `sketch.presentation` actions are incomplete; internal-alignment geometry
  restoration in row 10.83 is now the fail-closed boundary.
  The complete current `stevecad_tests` sweep is 2,939 passed with four
  intentional skips. Both protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero, with the final Part Design result reporting
  `"ok": true`. Final sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher,
  and SketcherGui builds are green; the upstream `TestViewProviderLink` suite
  is 5/5 green. The original 5-axis file was never saved or repaired and its
  SHA-256 remains exactly
  `f896d1c44bcf3249ac3c5b32e343dfe36210af3b0d4683527b1b3623612c7f37`.
  A fresh post-build GUI regression opened only a byte-identical disposable
  copy, found 29 links, exercised four representative linked objects through
  eight explicit `Face1`/`Edge1` preselection calls and 35 real viewport mouse
  moves, then closed normally without a SIGSEGV. Independent before/after
  hashes for the original and disposable copy remained exact, the temporary
  copy was moved to Trash, and no SteveCAD process remains.
- Internal-alignment restoration in row 10.83 is implemented as the explicit
  `restore_internal_alignment_geometry` variant of `sketch.geometry`. The
  request names the exact active Sketch, exact geometry, expected internal
  alignment state, and requested restoration type; the runtime supports the
  five live Sketcher alignment families, rejects stale or partial targets
  before mutation, uses one transaction, rolls back on verification failure,
  preserves selection/edit/ribbon/workbench state, and survives FCStd
  save/reopen. Its focused compiled-host gate passes exact human-command
  parity, atomicity, stale-target rejection, partial-target refusal, rollback,
  selection preservation, and reopen verification.
- Virtual-space switching in row 10.84 follows Sketcher's two distinct live
  semantics through one `set_virtual_space` constraint operation. With no
  selected constraints it changes only the active Sketch view's ephemeral
  real/virtual visibility and creates no transaction or undo record. With
  exact selected constraints it changes the durable
  `Constraint.InVirtualSpace` state atomically, verifies every requested
  target, and rejects stale state. The missing live `ViewSketch` and
  `ViewSection` actions are also implemented as `align_view_to_sketch` and
  `section_view` presentation operations. Camera alignment temporarily
  disables only the active view's animation so orientation can be applied and
  verified synchronously, then restores that view's exact prior animation
  setting; section view verifies and rolls back the Sketch's canonical view
  state.
- The production `sketch.edit` Native surface is now complete and available:
  all 85 shipped Sketch operations resolve into four concise tools, with Leave
  Sketch and Cancel Sketch remaining human-only. A real fresh-Sketch GUI gate
  captures the production turn-start context, freezes its nonempty Sketch-only
  surface, builds the actual Codex declarations, and executes a real
  `sketch.geometry/create_line` provider call. It then proves the required
  lifecycle: the frozen surface is stable during that turn; a human exit to
  Model causes the next turn to resolve Model tools; and human re-entry into
  Sketch causes the following turn to resolve the complete Sketch tools again.
  Exact singleton schema branches are normalized only at the provider adapter
  boundary, leaving the frozen schema and digest unchanged while satisfying
  the provider's object-root requirement.
- The Native Codex launch crash after rebasing onto `origin/main` was traced to
  the provider adapter re-resolving the live modeling surface on its worker
  thread after the turn had already been frozen. The adapter now validates the
  Codex declarations only against the frozen turn-start tool and modeling
  surfaces, so the human-selected surface is read on Qt before launch and is
  never queried again from the provider or nested tool-callback threads. A
  compiled GUI regression exercises the full provider-worker, Codex-callback,
  Native Sketch dispatch path and creates a real line successfully. The
  FreeCAD Python GUI binding also converts every off-main-thread guard failure
  into a normal catchable Python `RuntimeError` instead of allowing a C++
  exception to escape the Python callback boundary and abort the process.
- The post-split rolling compiled GUI gate passes all 85 Sketch operations,
  including internal alignment, both view actions, and both virtual-space
  modes. The focused provider/unit slice passes 60/60, and the full current
  `stevecad_tests` sweep passes 2,966 tests with four intentional skips. Both
  protected Sketcher and Part Design VibeScript integration lifecycles exit
  zero. Sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts, Sketcher, and SketcherGui
  builds are green, and the GUI-hosted `TestViewProviderLink` suite is 5/5
  green. The shared GUI support module was split at 1,076 lines into focused
  950-line support and 133-line provider-turn modules without changing its
  existing imports.
- Destructive curve cleanup now uses three focused provider contracts instead
  of advertising Trim, Split, and Extend through the broad
  `sketch.geometry` union. `sketch.cut` exposes only the identical exact
  curve-and-point fields shared by Trim and Split, `sketch.extend` exposes
  only its exact endpoint target, and `sketch.delete` exposes one bounded list
  of exact geometry indices. The provider schema rejects the misleading
  root-level `geometry_index`, `parameter`, and structured `target` shapes that
  caused the reported cleanup calls to fail. Delete Geometry freezes durable
  geometry and constraint identities, expands group handles and native
  internal-alignment helpers, refuses direct group-member/helper deletion,
  verifies every survivor and deletion against Sketcher's native mutation
  receipt, and preserves unrelated constraints, expressions, external
  geometry, and solver state. The production frozen Sketch surface is 65,516
  bytes under the unchanged 65,536-byte limit. Real compiled GUI gates pass
  fresh provider launch, all Trim outcomes, both Split outcomes, and exact
  Delete Geometry with related-constraint cleanup, one undo, redo, and FCStd
  save/reopen. The complete Python regression suite is 3,328 passed with four
  intentional skips. The expanded rolling GUI gate reaches and passes the new
  Delete case, then currently stops later at an unrelated Scale-case undo
  count assertion; the dedicated cleanup gates are green.
- The `sketch.edit` surface now excludes `document.save` and continues to
  exclude `document.open`. It exposes one `sketch.control/leave` operation that
  exact-targets the active document UID, Sketch object, and expected geometry
  and constraint counts. The shared C++ exit path validates the exact edit task
  before accepting it, and its Python boundary converts all native failures to
  catchable Python exceptions. A compiled GUI gate proves unavailable Save and
  Open calls do not mutate or leave the Sketch, stale identity and state are
  rejected without leaving, the exact Leave preserves the Sketch and active
  workbench, the current turn is invalidated, and a fresh turn resolves the
  post-edit surface where Save is available. This supersedes the earlier
  human-only Leave Sketch boundary.
  Final verification passes the sequential SteveCADScripts, SketcherScripts,
  Sketcher, and SketcherGui builds; the complete `stevecad_tests` sweep; both
  protected VibeScript lifecycles; the exact Leave GUI lifecycle; and both
  provider-worker dispatch regressions. The existing human Leave Sketch test
  also accepts a provisional Sketch as one global history operation. Broader
  GUI suites remain sensitive to the fixed 1440-pixel test display: the ribbon
  theme gate stops at its 1854-pixel width assertion, and three Sketcher GUI
  cases reject projected click points outside the viewport before reaching the
  operation under test.
- The only remaining production Native raw GUI command, Sketch section-view
  toggling, now uses an exact active-document, document-UID, Sketch-object C++
  API. An architecture gate rejects Native domain use of workbench activation,
  raw commands, edit-mode entry/exit, full-registry imports, hidden
  implementation lookup, and nested binding access. The dispatcher
  reauthorizes the frozen surface and exact document after every handler, while
  the mutation runner reauthorizes immediately before commit and aborts its
  transaction if authority changes. The exact `sketch.control/leave` operation
  is the sole controlled surface-transition exception and must prove both the
  expected `NATIVE_SURFACE_CHANGED` result and its exact next surface. Model
  sketch creation remains outside edit mode and returns
  `next_step.human_action = open_created_sketch`. Focused tests cover switches
  before a call, during mutation, and between calls; the complete pure-Python
  suite, exact compiled GUI lifecycles, required sequential builds, and both
  protected VibeScript integrations are green.
- The 5-axis Documents fixture was changed outside the immutable regression
  after the earlier recorded `f896d1...` baseline: at the final check it had a
  new 08:33 timestamp, a new FreeCAD backup, and SHA-256
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  It was not saved, repaired, or modified during this verification. A
  byte-identical disposable copy of the current file opened and closed in the
  compiled GUI without a SIGSEGV after exercising 29 links, eight explicit
  face/edge preselection calls, and 35 real viewport mouse moves; the current
  original hash remained exact afterward and the disposable test directory
  was moved to Trash.
- Ribbon authority now includes the exact compiled and preference environment,
  not only the currently materialized action graph. A generated GUI header
  records 21 ribbon-relevant CMake feature flags. The controller separately
  publishes the three CAM and two Drawing preferences that can change the
  graph, observes only those five keys, and advances the same monotonic surface
  revision when either the manifest or this environment changes. The strict
  Python reader rejects missing, extra, mistyped, or surface-inappropriate
  environment fields; its canonical environment digest is part of both the
  authorization token and provider modeling-surface ID. Session creation now
  compares that exact frozen ID, closing the provider-launch-to-dispatcher gap
  even when a human leaves and returns to the same ribbon or a relevant setting
  changes between turns.
  Pure contracts prove both compiled-feature and preference drift invalidate a
  frozen turn without mutation. The compiled Drawing GUI lifecycle toggles a
  graph-shaping preference and proves revision, manifest digest, and
  environment digest all change, then restores the user's exact prior value.
  Default live counts remain Model 75, Assemble 53, Mesh 60, Analyze 104,
  Manufacture 57, Drawing 107, Parameters 24, Sketch setup 15, and Sketch edit
  105. The real Model provider workflow, fresh-Sketch inter-turn swap, and
  exact Leave Sketch lifecycle all pass. The complete current Python suite,
  final sequential SteveCADScripts/SketcherScripts/Sketcher/SketcherGui builds,
  and both protected VibeScript integrations are green. The Drawing preference
  is restored to `false`, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Native turn assembly now resolves one live ribbon manifest and derives both
  modeling identity and schemas from that exact frozen object. Conditional
  Analyze, Manufacture, and all four Drawing preference graphs no longer
  inherit phantom actions from a default graph. MCP forwards the same frozen
  surface and exposes no provider workbench-switch command; only the GUI can
  change ribbons between turns. The retired direct layer was reduced by 121
  implementation modules and six obsolete test suites. Durable Assembly, FEM,
  Drawing, Manufacture, and Part regeneration rebinding now lives in five
  focused modules backed by one exact-selection module, without old provider
  schemas or mutation entry points. The service package now contains only 20
  registered VibeScript/shared tools and one shared runtime. Milestone
  verification is 2,926
  passed with four intentional skips, all four required build targets green,
  both protected VibeScript lifecycles green, and the 5-axis fixture hash
  unchanged.
- The contextual Sketch surface now includes one bounded atomic `sketch.batch`
  create operation alongside the exact single-operation tools. One request can
  add 1–32 points, lines, circles, or circular arcs and 1–16 supported
  constraints using client-local references. All references, geometry kinds,
  point positions, dimensions, active-Sketch identity, and expected counts are
  resolved before a transaction. Sketcher's additional-constraint diagnosis
  rejects redundancy or conflicts before durable constraint insertion, and
  any later degeneracy or postcondition failure rolls back the entire batch.
  Success returns stable host geometry IDs and exact constraint indices plus a
  concise closed-profile and solver summary. The exact production Sketch
  surface serializes to 63,246 bytes under the unchanged 65,536-byte cap.
  A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves a fully constrained four-line
  profile with 11 constraints in one mutating call, invalid-reference no-op,
  redundant-batch rollback, exact duplicate-call replay, one undo step, exact
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/reopen. A second rolled-back catalog batch exercises
  point, circle, arc, Parallel, Perpendicular, Equal, Angle, Radius, Diameter,
  and Distance construction paths. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_BATCH_GUI_OK schema_bytes=63246 profile_mutations=1
  catalog_mutations=1 geometry=4 constraints=11`. The complete pure suite is
  2,934 passed with four intentional skips, Ruff is green, both protected
  VibeScript integrations exit zero, and the 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- The Assemble structure family implements the live
  `Assembly_CreateAssembly`, `Assembly_InsertLink`, and
  `Assembly_InsertNewPart` actions. Assembly creation rechecks the expected
  Assembly count and exact human-active parent both before and inside its
  transaction, honors the one-root preference, and creates one native
  `Assembly::AssemblyObject` with one `Assembly::JointGroup`. Existing-source
  insertion requires the exact open source document UID/name and source object
  name/ID from bounded Assemble state, rejects stale objects, unsaved external
  documents, non-component sources, and dependency cycles, and creates the
  correct `App::Link` or `Assembly::AssemblyLink`. Placement, rigid/flexible
  state, native managed-clone ownership, and the placement transform that a
  flexible AssemblyLink distributes into its cloned components are verified
  after recompute. Automatic grounding is deliberately absent because Ground
  is its own later operation.
- New Part creates one current-document `App::Part`, its empty
  `PartDesign::Body`, and one Assembly occurrence as a single timeline
  operation. Native does not activate the Body, change Assembly edit mode,
  change selection, or open either human task dialog. `Assembly_ActivateAssembly`
  remains human-only. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves invalid and
  stale no-ops, root/nested creation, same-document component insertion,
  non-identity flexible external-subassembly insertion, exact native clone
  resources, new-Part timeline ownership, duplicate replay, five independent
  undo/redo entries, unchanged human activation, and two-document FCStd
  save/reopen. It reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_STRUCTURE_GUI_OK
  assemblies=2 components=4 transactions=5 active_read=true`. The complete
  pure suite is 2,948 passed with four intentional skips; Ruff and sequential
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui builds are green.
  The protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all
  exit zero; the Part Design result reports `"ok": true`.
- Assemble Ground and Unground are one desired-state `assembly.joint`
  operation mapped from the live `Assembly_ToggleGrounded` action. A bounded
  request names the exact human-active Assembly and each exact component,
  supplies the expected component and grounded-joint counts, and states every
  component's expected current grounding state. Preflight runs both before and
  inside the transaction and rejects stale, duplicate, malformed, foreign,
  inactive-timeline, or no-op targets before mutation. Human and Native paths
  share the same Assembly ownership predicate; Native creates the real
  `GroundedJoint` and `ViewProviderGroundedJoint`, verifies timeline ownership
  and placement-property locking, and removes the exact joint when ungrounding.
  It leaves human selection and Assembly activation unchanged and returns exact
  created, deleted, and changed-object receipts. A dispatcher-backed compiled
  GUI gate proves two-component atomic ground, duplicate replay, one-step
  undo/redo, partial unground, a second undo/redo cycle, and FCStd save/reopen;
  it reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_GROUNDING_GUI_OK components=2
  ground_batch=2 unground=1 transactions=2 reopen=true`. The complete suite is
  2,953 passed with four intentional skips; Ruff and sequential SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui builds are green. The protected
  Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all exit zero,
  no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Fixed Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_fixed` operation
  mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointFixed` action. Its bounded request
  names two distinct active movable components using normalized
  component-relative object/Face/Edge/Vertex paths, exact compatible anchor
  paths, complete connector offsets, expected component placements, expected
  component/grounded/regular-joint counts, the expected solve-on-creation
  preference, and explicit label/reverse state. Preflight runs before and
  inside the transaction and rejects stale placements or counts, malformed or
  foreign joint graphs, unsupported anchors, same-component targets, and an
  existing Fixed pair without mutation. Native creates one real Assembly
  `Joint` with `JointObject.Joint` and `ViewProviderJoint`, uses the same
  connector and reverse operations as the human task path, preserves selection
  and human Assembly activation, and verifies exact topology references,
  offsets, timeline ownership, object graph, moved placements, and bounded
  solver diagnostics. A conflicting, redundant, malformed, or otherwise
  rejected solve rolls back the transaction; the human-equivalent ungrounded
  deferred-solve status remains representable. Assemble state now exposes
  exact component placements and shape counts, regular joints separately from
  grounded joints, the solve preference, and the last bounded solver result.
  A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves a stale-count no-op, two solved
  Fixed joints with full offsets, reverse behavior, exact duplicate replay,
  undo/redo after each transaction, and FCStd save/close/reopen with both model
  and view proxies restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_FIXED_JOINT_GUI_OK components=3 joints=2
  reverse=true transactions=2 reopen=true`. The complete suite is 2,969
  passed with four intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript
  integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Revolute Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_revolute`
  operation mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointRevolute` action. It
  reuses a shared regular-joint engine extracted from the proven Fixed path;
  the public Fixed contract remains intact while connector, graph, solver,
  receipt, activation, selection, and lifecycle verification logic has one
  implementation for later joint families. The Revolute request adds explicit
  minimum and maximum enabled states and degree values matching the human
  task UI's `-180` through `180` range. Enabled inverted bounds, non-finite or
  out-of-range angles, stale counts/placements/preferences, duplicate
  Revolute pairs, and malformed graphs all fail before mutation. Native sets
  the real `EnableAngleMin`, `AngleMin`, `EnableAngleMax`, and `AngleMax`
  properties before connector solve, applies full offsets and reverse state,
  and performs a final solve so returned diagnostics describe the final
  configured pose. Bounded Assemble state now returns complete connector
  offsets and angular limits for regular joints. A dispatcher-backed compiled
  GUI gate proves stale-count no-op, exact offsets, both enabled limits,
  reverse behavior, final solver success, duplicate replay, one-step
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with native model and view proxies,
  references, offsets, and limits restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_REVOLUTE_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  limits=true reverse=true transactions=1 reopen=true`; the original Fixed
  lifecycle gate remains green after extraction. The complete suite is 2,978
  passed with four intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript
  integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Cylindrical Joint is an exact
  `assembly.joint/create_cylindrical` operation mapped from the live
  `Assembly_CreateJointCylindrical` action. It uses the proven shared
  regular-joint engine and names two exact component-rooted connectors with
  complete offsets, expected component placements, label, reverse state,
  expected component/grounded/regular-joint counts, and the expected
  solve-on-creation preference. Its request carries independent enabled states
  and values for minimum/maximum linear travel and minimum/maximum angular
  travel. Angles match the human task UI's `-180` through `180` degree range;
  lengths must be finite and remain inside the existing Native coordinate
  envelope of `-1,000,000` through `1,000,000` mm because the human length
  controls impose no narrower range. Enabled inverted pairs, non-finite or
  out-of-envelope values, stale state, duplicate Cylindrical pairs, invalid
  connectors, and malformed graphs fail without mutation. Native writes all
  eight real Assembly limit properties before connector solve and performs a
  final solve after reverse configuration. Concise Assemble state now exposes
  both linear and angular limits for Cylindrical joints. A dispatcher-backed
  compiled GUI gate proves stale-count no-op, full offsets, all four enabled
  bounds, reverse behavior, final solver success, duplicate replay, one-step
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with model/view proxies, references,
  offsets, and both limit families restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_CYLINDRICAL_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  length_limits=true angle_limits=true reverse=true transactions=1
  reopen=true`; the Fixed and Revolute lifecycle gates remain green against
  the expanded shared engine. The complete suite is 2,995 passed with four
  intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are green. The
  protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all
  exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture
  remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Slider Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_slider` operation
  mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointSlider` action. It uses the proven
  shared regular-joint engine with Assembly type index 3 and names two exact
  component-rooted connectors with complete offsets, expected component
  placements, label, reverse state, expected component/grounded/regular-joint
  counts, and the expected solve-on-creation preference. The full connector
  offsets preserve the human task UI's Advanced offsets and simplified
  second-connector yaw; no separate rotation field is invented. Slider permits
  translation along the connector axis while restricting rotation, and its
  only real limit properties are `EnableLengthMin`, `LengthMin`,
  `EnableLengthMax`, and `LengthMax`. Independent enabled states and finite
  values use the existing Native coordinate envelope of `-1,000,000` through
  `1,000,000` mm because the human length controls impose no narrower range.
  Enabled inverted bounds, non-finite or out-of-envelope values, stale state,
  duplicate Slider pairs, invalid connectors, and malformed graphs fail
  before mutation. Native writes the four exact properties before connector
  solve, performs a final solve after reverse configuration, and preserves
  activation and human selection. Concise Assemble state exposes linear
  limits for Slider without fabricating angular limits. A dispatcher-backed
  compiled GUI gate proves stale-count no-op, full offsets, both enabled
  linear bounds, reverse behavior, final solver success, duplicate replay,
  one-step undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with model/view proxies,
  references, offsets, limits, and bounded state restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_SLIDER_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  limits=true reverse=true transactions=1 reopen=true`; the Fixed, Revolute,
  and Cylindrical lifecycle gates remain green against the expanded shared
  engine. The complete suite is 3,009 passed with four intentional skips;
  Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts,
  Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are green. The protected Sketcher,
  Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD
  test process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Ball Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_ball` operation mapped
  from the live `Assembly_CreateJointBall` action. It uses Assembly type index
  4 and the shared regular-joint engine, which reaches the compiled spherical
  solver used by the human command. Its two exact component-rooted connectors
  retain complete advanced attachment offsets and expected component
  placements, while the joint holds the connector points coincident and leaves
  rotation unrestricted. The provider schema deliberately omits reverse,
  simplified rotation, distance, and limit fields because the human Ball task
  exposes none of those controls; the concise result likewise omits the shared
  engine's internal false reverse state and empty property map. Expected
  component, grounded, and regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation
  preference guard stale requests before mutation. Invalid connectors,
  duplicate Ball pairs, malformed graphs, changed placements, and inapplicable
  fields fail closed. Native performs the human pre-solve and a final solve,
  then proves exact object identity, proxies, point references, full offsets,
  solver status, activation, and selection. Concise Assemble state returns the
  Ball connectors without fabricating linear or angular limits. A
  dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves stale-count no-op, two real
  vertex connectors, independent full offsets, final solver success,
  idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with
  model/view proxies, references, offsets, and bounded state restored. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_BALL_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  point_connectors=true offsets=true transactions=1 reopen=true`; the Fixed,
  Revolute, Cylindrical, and Slider lifecycle gates remain green against the
  expanded shared engine. The complete suite is 3,016 passed with four
  intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are green. The
  protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all
  exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture
  remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Distance Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_distance`
  operation mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointDistance` action. It
  uses Assembly type index 5, writes the human joint's exact signed `Distance`
  property, supports the human Reverse control, and retains the complete
  independent Offset1 and Offset2 placements from the Advanced controls. It
  deliberately exposes no simplified offset/rotation or linear/angular limit
  fields because the human Distance task has none. Finite distance values use
  the Native coordinate envelope of `-1,000,000` through `1,000,000` mm; bool,
  non-finite, and out-of-envelope values fail before mutation. The contract
  derives the same 37 point, line, circle, curve, plane, cylinder, cone, torus,
  sphere, and fallback geometry modes as the compiled Distance implementation,
  and requires `expected_distance_mode` so topology drift cannot silently
  change solver semantics. Native mirrors the compiled implementation's
  canonical connector priority before creating the joint. This is essential
  because the compiled canonicalizer swaps Reference1/Reference2 and
  Placement1/Placement2 for mixed geometry but does not swap Offset1/Offset2;
  canonicalizing the connector specifications first keeps each complete offset
  attached to its intended component. Expected component, grounded, and
  regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference guard stale
  requests before mutation. Invalid connectors, changed placements, duplicate
  Distance pairs, malformed graphs, changed geometry modes, and inapplicable
  fields fail closed. Concise Assembly state reports the exact signed distance
  and derived mode without invoking the mutating compiled canonicalizer or
  fabricating limit fields. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves a
  deliberately reversed point/plane request is canonicalized with offset
  ownership intact, then verifies stale-count no-op, Reverse, the 18 mm signed
  value, final solver success, idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd
  save/close/reopen with model/view proxies, references, offsets, mode, and
  bounded state restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_DISTANCE_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  mode=point_plane canonicalized=true distance_mm=18 reverse=true
  transactions=1 reopen=true`; the Fixed, Revolute, Cylindrical, Slider, and
  Ball lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is 3,042 passed with
  four intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript
  integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Parallel Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_parallel`
  operation mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointParallel` action. It
  uses Assembly type index 6 and reaches the compiled
  `ASMTParallelAxesJoint` used by the human command. The two exact
  component-rooted connectors preserve independent complete Offset1 and
  Offset2 placements, and the operation supports the human Reverse control.
  No distance, angle, simplified rotation, or limit properties are invented;
  the human task's Rotate 90 control merely changes the second full attachment
  offset, which Native already represents exactly. Expected component,
  grounded, and regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference
  guard stale requests. Invalid connectors, duplicate Parallel pairs,
  malformed graphs, changed component placements, and inapplicable fields
  fail before mutation. In addition to proving exact type, proxies,
  references, offsets, reverse state, activation, selection, and solver
  status, Native verifies the live global connector axes satisfy the actual
  Parallel postcondition. Both equal and anti-parallel directions are valid,
  matching the human command's cross-product semantics. Concise Assembly
  state reports `axes_parallel` without fabricating joint properties. A
  dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate starts with both the arm and its second
  connector deliberately misaligned, then proves the solver establishes the
  semantic axis relationship, stale-count no-op, independent full offsets,
  Reverse, idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd
  save/close/reopen with model/view proxies, references, offsets, and bounded
  state restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_PARALLEL_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  axes_parallel=true reverse=true offsets=true transactions=1 reopen=true`;
  the Fixed, Revolute, Cylindrical, Slider, Ball, and Distance lifecycle gates
  remain green. The complete suite is 3,052 passed with four intentional
  skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, and the SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build targets are green. The
  protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript integrations all
  exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture
  remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Perpendicular Joint is an exact
  `assembly.joint/create_perpendicular` operation mapped from the live
  `Assembly_CreateJointPerpendicular` action. It uses Assembly type index 7
  and reaches the compiled `ASMTPerpendicularJoint` used by the human command,
  whose real constraint makes the two connector coordinate systems' global Z
  axes orthogonal. The two exact component-rooted connectors preserve complete,
  independent Offset1 and Offset2 placements. Reverse, angle, distance,
  simplified rotation, and limit fields are deliberately absent because the
  human Perpendicular task exposes none of them. Expected component, grounded,
  and regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference guard stale
  requests. Invalid connectors, duplicate Perpendicular pairs, malformed
  graphs, changed component placements, and inapplicable fields fail before
  mutation. Native follows the human command's `preventParallel` connector
  path, including its 10-degree X-axis perturbation of the moving component
  when the initial connector axes are parallel, so the solver does not begin
  from that singular orientation. It then verifies the live global connector
  Z-axis dot product as an exact `axes_perpendicular` semantic postcondition,
  in addition to exact type, proxies, references, offsets, solver status,
  activation, and selection. Concise Assembly state reports that semantic
  relationship without fabricating joint properties. A dispatcher-backed
  compiled GUI gate deliberately starts with the exact connector axes parallel
  by using yaw-only full offsets, then proves the perturbation-and-solve path,
  stale-count no-op, independent offsets, moved-component reporting,
  idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with model
  and view proxies, references, offsets, semantic state, and bounded summary
  restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_PERPENDICULAR_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  initial_parallel=true axes_perpendicular=true offsets=true transactions=1
  reopen=true`; the Fixed, Revolute, Cylindrical, Slider, Ball, Distance, and
  Parallel lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is 3,064 passed
  with four intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build-tree
  byte comparison, and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and
  AssemblyGui build targets are green. The protected Sketcher, Part Design,
  and Assembly VibeScript integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process
  remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Angle Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_angle` operation
  mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointAngle` action. It uses Assembly
  type index 8, persists the human task's real `Angle` property, and reaches
  the compiled `ASMTAngleJoint`, whose constraint is the global connector-Z
  dot product `cos(abs(Angle))`. Native deliberately accepts the one canonical
  geometric range from 0 through 180 degrees instead of exposing the raw
  property's negative and periodic aliases as false choices. At zero, it
  mirrors the compiled `AssemblyObject` special case that substitutes
  `ASMTParallelAxesJoint`; concise results and state name that relation
  `parallel_unsigned` so equal and anti-parallel zero-angle outcomes cannot be
  misread. All other canonical values report `axis_dot_cosine`. Two exact
  component-rooted connectors retain complete, independent Offset1 and Offset2
  placements. Reverse, distance, simplified rotation, and limit fields are
  absent because the human Angle task exposes none of them. Expected component,
  grounded, and regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference
  guard stale requests. Invalid connectors, duplicate Angle pairs, malformed
  graphs, changed component placements, non-finite or non-canonical angles,
  and inapplicable fields fail before mutation. Native follows the human
  `preventParallel` connector path, including its 10-degree global connector-X
  perturbation when the initial axes are parallel. It then verifies the live
  global connector-axis dot product against the exact compiled relation and
  reports the stored canonical angle, measured principal axis angle, relation,
  and satisfaction without leaking the shared engine's internal false Reverse
  state or property map. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate deliberately
  starts with exact connector axes parallel through yaw-only full offsets and
  proves the real 60-degree cosine solver, stale-count no-op, property and
  offset persistence, moved-component reporting, idempotent replay, one-step
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen with model and view proxies,
  references, semantic state, and bounded summary restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_ANGLE_JOINT_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1
  initial_parallel=true angle_degrees=60 angle_satisfied=true offsets=true
  transactions=1 reopen=true`; all eight previously completed compiled joint
  lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is 3,086 passed with four
  intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build-tree byte
  comparison, and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui
  build targets are green. The protected Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly
  VibeScript integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process remains, and
  the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Rack-and-Pinion Joint is an exact
  `assembly.joint/create_rack_pinion` operation mapped from the live
  `Assembly_CreateJointRackPinion` action. It uses Assembly type index 9,
  persists the human task's real signed `Distance` pitch-radius property, and
  reaches the compiled `ASMTRackPinionJoint`, whose exact coupling relation is
  `rack travel mm per pinion radian = -pitch radius`. The contract requires the
  exact active Slider joint for the rack and exact active Revolute joint for
  the pinion instead of relying on the compiled engine's ambiguous scan for any
  matching Slider. It also requires semantically named rack and pinion
  connectors that exactly reuse the corresponding prerequisite joint side,
  including component, element and anchor paths, and complete attachment
  offset. Preflight proves both prerequisites are active in the human-active
  Assembly, have the required joint types, constrain distinct rack and pinion
  components, leave those components ungrounded, and expose perpendicular live
  Slider and Revolute axes. Native creates the rack as connector one and the
  pinion as connector two, then verifies that the compiled solve did not swap
  or drift that exact persisted dependency graph. The pitch radius accepts the
  human task's complete signed direction semantics while rejecting Boolean,
  zero, non-finite, sub-tolerance, and unbounded values. Reverse, angle,
  simplified offset/rotation, limits, and a second radius are absent because
  the human Rack-and-Pinion task exposes none of them. Expected component,
  grounded, and regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference
  guard stale requests before mutation. Concise results report the two
  semantic connectors, both exact prerequisite identities, pitch radius,
  signed travel ratio, and perpendicular-axis proof without leaking the shared
  engine's false Reverse value or raw property map. Concise state reconstructs
  the prerequisites from persisted connector equality after save/reopen and
  explicitly reports whether that graph still resolves. A dispatcher-backed
  compiled GUI gate builds a real grounded base, global-X Slider rack, and
  global-Z Revolute pinion, then proves stale-count no-op, real solver status
  zero, exact dependency reuse, canonical side order, idempotent replay,
  one-step undo/redo that preserves both prerequisites, and FCStd
  save/close/reopen with model and view proxies, references, offsets, ratio,
  axis semantics, and bounded state restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_RACK_PINION_JOINT_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  prerequisites=true pitch_radius_mm=20 ratio=-20 axes_perpendicular=true
  transactions=1 reopen=true`; all nine previously completed compiled joint
  lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is 3,109 passed with four
  intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build-tree byte
  comparison, and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui
  build targets are green. The protected Sketcher, all 17 Part Design phases,
  and Assembly VibeScript integrations exit zero, no SteveCAD test process
  remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Screw Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_screw` operation
  mapped from the live `Assembly_CreateJointScrew` action. It uses Assembly
  type index 10, persists the human task's real signed `Distance` thread-pitch
  property, and reaches the compiled `ASMTScrewJoint`, whose constraint is
  `2*pi*z - pitch*theta - constant = 0`. Results therefore distinguish the
  persisted relative axial advance per relative revolution from the slider's
  travel per screw revolution; for the canonical fixed-base arrangement the
  latter is the negative of the signed pitch. The contract requires an exact
  active Slider prerequisite for the translating component and an exact active
  Revolute prerequisite for the screw instead of relying on the compiled
  engine's ambiguous scan for a matching Slider. Semantically named slider and
  screw connectors must exactly reuse the corresponding prerequisite side,
  including component, element and anchor paths, and complete attachment
  offset. Preflight proves both prerequisites are active in the human-active
  Assembly, have the required joint types, constrain distinct ungrounded
  components, and place their live connector Z axes on one directed collinear
  line rather than merely parallel lines. Native persists the slider as
  connector one and screw as connector two, then verifies that the compiled
  solve did not swap or drift the exact dependency graph. Signed pitch accepts
  the human task's complete direction semantics while rejecting Boolean, zero,
  non-finite, sub-tolerance, and unbounded values. Reverse, angle, simplified
  offset/rotation, limits, and secondary-distance fields are absent because
  the human Screw task exposes none of them. Expected component, grounded, and
  regular-joint counts plus the solve-on-creation preference guard stale
  requests before mutation. Concise results return semantic connectors, both
  exact prerequisite identities, signed pitch, both motion-rate conventions,
  and the collinearity proof without leaking the shared engine's false Reverse
  value or raw property map. Concise state reconstructs both prerequisites from
  persisted connector equality after save/reopen and explicitly reports
  whether the graph still resolves. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate
  builds a real grounded base, Slider component, and Revolute screw component,
  then proves stale-count no-op, real solver status zero, exact dependency
  reuse, canonical side order, idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo preserving
  both prerequisites, and FCStd save/close/reopen with model and view proxies,
  references, offsets, rates, axis semantics, and bounded state restored. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_SCREW_JOINT_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  prerequisites=true thread_pitch_mm=-2 slider_travel_mm_per_revolution=2
  axes_collinear=true transactions=1 reopen=true`; all ten previously completed
  compiled joint lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is 3,133
  passed with four intentional skips; Ruff lint, new-file Ruff formatting,
  compileall, diff checks, ten applicable source/build-tree byte comparisons,
  and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build
  targets are green. The protected Sketcher, all 17 Part Design phases, and
  Assembly VibeScript integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process
  remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Gears Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_gears` operation
  mapped from the live plural `Assembly_CreateJointGears` action and persisted
  `Gears` joint type rather than inventing a renamed command or compatibility
  alias. It uses Assembly type index 11 and persists the human task's two real
  `Distance` and `Distance2` properties as `radius1_mm` and `radius2_mm`. Both
  radii follow the task's strictly positive range and reject Boolean, zero,
  negative, non-finite, sub-tolerance, and unbounded values before mutation.
  The compiled `ASMTGearJoint` relation is
  `theta2 + (radius1 / radius2) * theta1 = constant`, so concise output names
  the second rotation per first rotation as `-(radius1 / radius2)` and reports
  the opposite direction explicitly. The contract requires two distinct exact
  active Revolute prerequisites and semantically named gear connectors that
  exactly reuse their corresponding prerequisite side, including component,
  element and anchor paths, and complete attachment offset. Preflight proves
  the two Revolute joints constrain distinct ungrounded rotating components;
  it deliberately does not invent an axis-parallelism rule absent from the
  human task and compiled rotational coupling. Native persists the first and
  second gear in radius order and verifies that the compiled solve did not
  swap or drift that dependency graph. Reverse, angle, simplified
  offset/rotation, and limit fields are absent: the human task's direction
  checkbox switches between the separate Gears and Belt joint types instead
  of setting a Gears property. Expected component, grounded, and regular-joint
  counts plus the solve-on-creation preference guard stale requests before
  mutation. Concise state reconstructs both Revolute prerequisites from
  persisted connector equality after save/reopen and reports whether the
  exact graph still resolves. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate uses two
  distinct real shaft axes, proves stale-count no-op, real solver status zero,
  exact dependency reuse, radius order, ratio and direction, idempotent replay,
  one-step undo/redo preserving both prerequisites, and FCStd
  save/close/reopen with model and view proxies, references, offsets, semantic
  state, and bounded summary restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_GEARS_JOINT_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  prerequisites=true radius1_mm=20 radius2_mm=40 ratio=-0.5
  direction=opposite transactions=1 reopen=true`; all eleven previously
  completed compiled joint lifecycle gates remain green. The complete suite is
  3,158 passed with four intentional skips; Ruff lint, new-file Ruff formatting,
  compileall, diff checks, eight applicable source/build-tree byte comparisons,
  and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui build
  targets are green. The protected Sketcher, all 17 Part Design phases, and
  Assembly VibeScript integrations all exit zero, no SteveCAD test process or
  test-created crash lock remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains
  exactly `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Assemble Belt Joint is an exact `assembly.joint/create_belt` operation mapped
  from the live `Assembly_CreateJointBelt` action and persisted `Belt` joint
  type. It uses the human command's type index 12 and stores the task panel's
  positive Radius 1 and Radius 2 values in the real `Distance` and `Distance2`
  properties. Boolean, zero, negative, non-finite, sub-tolerance, and unbounded
  radii fail before mutation. The compiled Belt path uses `ASMTGearJoint` with
  a negated second solver radius, yielding
  `theta2 - (radius1 / radius2) * theta1 = constant`; concise output therefore
  reports `+(radius1 / radius2)` as the second rotation per first rotation and
  names the direction `same`. The contract accepts only two distinct exact
  active Revolute prerequisites and semantically named pulley connectors that
  reuse their corresponding prerequisite sides completely: component,
  element path, anchor path, and attachment offset. Both pulley components
  must remain ungrounded and the prerequisites may not cross-constrain the
  other pulley. Native deliberately does not invent an axis-parallelism rule
  absent from the human task and compiled relation. Reverse, angle, simplified
  offset/rotation, and limit fields are absent because the task checkbox
  selects between the separate Gears and Belt types rather than persisting a
  direction property. Expected component, grounded, regular-joint, and
  solve-on-creation state rejects stale requests without a transaction. A new
  shared 373-line two-Revolute rotation-coupling engine now owns the common
  prerequisite, exact-side, regular-joint, verification, and concise-result
  mechanics; the Gears and Belt contracts are each 170-line semantic wrappers
  with opposite and same direction fixed by their respective persisted joint
  types. Concise Assembly state restores both prerequisite identities and the
  signed ratio after reopen. The dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate proves a
  stale-count no-op, real solver status zero, exact dependency reuse, radius
  order, `+0.5` same-direction output, idempotent replay, one-step undo/redo,
  and FCStd save/close/reopen with model/view proxies, references, offsets, and
  state restored. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_BELT_JOINT_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  prerequisites=true radius1_mm=20 radius2_mm=40 ratio=0.5 direction=same
  transactions=1 reopen=true`. Completing Belt makes the entire
  `assembly.joint` capability definition and implementation complete while
  Native remains globally unavailable until the rest of this plan is done.
  All thirteen compiled joint lifecycle gates pass. The complete SteveCAD suite
  is 3,184 passed with four intentional skips; Ruff, compileall, diff checks,
  source/build parity, and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and
  AssemblyGui targets are green. The protected Sketcher gate exits zero, all
  17 Part Design phases report `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_PHASE_OK`, and the Assembly
  VibeScript gate returns `STEVECAD_ASSEMBLY_VIBESCRIPT_GATE_EXIT 0` with every
  published joint solver code zero. No VibeScript source changed.
  No FreeCAD or FreeCADCmd process remains, the preserved pre-existing recovery
  snapshot and lock are untouched, the prior test-created crash lock remains
  absent, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Solve Assembly is an exact `assembly.structure/solve_assembly` operation
  mapped only from the live `Assembly_SolveAssembly` action. It accepts only
  the exact human-active Assembly plus the current component, grounded-joint,
  and regular-joint counts and a lowercase SHA-256 of its bounded solver state.
  That state fingerprints at most 128 native solver placement objects by
  document identity, object identity and type, exact placement, and both
  `Placement` and `LinkPlacement` read-only state. Stale counts, stale state,
  a different active Assembly, inactive timeline objects, or an oversized
  placement graph all fail before a transaction opens. The implementation
  follows the human command's native lifecycle with `assembly.solve(False)`
  followed by one full document recompute inside one named transaction. A
  solver exception, nonzero status, invalid Assembly, recompute failure,
  deleted object, changed placement-object graph, unexpected created object,
  post-solve drift, active-Assembly drift, selection drift, or moved grounded
  component aborts the transaction. The only allowed solver-created objects
  are exact native grounding repairs for components whose placement was
  already locked; those repairs, their targets, and the JointGroup membership
  are verified before commit. Success returns only before/after state hashes,
  bounded exact placement changes, lock changes, grounding repairs, counts,
  and concise solver health instead of the raw diagnostic graph. The focused
  solve and state modules are 473 and 230 lines, and the dispatcher-backed
  compiled GUI gate proves free-motion solving, native grounding repair, stale
  state no-op, exact constrained movement, unchanged grounded placement,
  preserved selection and active Assembly, idempotent replay, one-step
  undo/redo, and FCStd save/close/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_SOLVE_GUI_OK components=2 joints=1 grounded=1
  moved=1 free_motion=true grounding_repair=true stale_noop=true
  selection=true transactions=2 undo_redo=true reopen=true`. All thirteen
  compiled joint lifecycle gates plus the structure, grounding, and solve gates
  pass. The complete SteveCAD suite is 3,193 passed with four intentional skips;
  Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build parity, and the SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are green. The protected
  Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases report
  `STEVECAD_VIBESCRIPT_PHASE_OK`, and the Assembly VibeScript gate returns
  explicit `"ok": true`, every published joint solver code zero, and
  `STEVECAD_ASSEMBLY_VIBESCRIPT_GATE_EXIT 0`. No VibeScript source changed. No
  FreeCAD or FreeCADCmd process remains, the preserved recovery snapshot and
  lock are untouched, the prior test-created crash lock remains absent, and
  the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
- Conflicting-constraint diagnosis is an exact read-only
  `assembly.diagnose/select_conflicting_constraints` operation mapped only from
  the live `Assembly_SelectConflictingConstraints` action. It reads the same
  most-recent compiled solver diagnosis used by the human command without
  invoking another solve, changing selection, opening a transaction, or
  mutating the document. Its bounded state capture cross-checks the exact
  human-active Assembly, native JointGroup, components, grounded and regular
  joints, solver placement hash, status, message, remaining degrees of freedom,
  category flags and names, per-joint constraint counts, redundancy flags,
  removed degrees of freedom, signed residuals, absolute residuals, and maximum
  residuals. Duplicate, unknown, inconsistent, oversized, non-finite, stale,
  malformed, or selection-drifting diagnostics fail closed. The provider
  request supplies the exact Assembly, diagnosis SHA-256, all relevant counts,
  and a bounded page; success returns only exact conflicting-joint references,
  labels/types, both semantic connectors and offsets, constraint and violating
  counts, maximum residuals, solver status/DoF/tolerance, and pagination state.
  Assemble snapshots classify unavailable or incomplete diagnostic graphs as a
  bounded unavailable summary rather than breaking state capture. A
  dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate creates an impossible 3-4-7.1 distance
  loop, proves native solve status `-1`, compares Native's exact three-joint set
  with the real human selection command, verifies residual evidence, two-page
  pagination, stale-state no-ops, unchanged selection/objects/placements/undo
  and transaction state, idempotent replay, and FCStd save/close/reopen followed
  by another compiled solve. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_CONFLICT_DIAGNOSIS_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  conflicts=3 solver_status=-1 human_match=true pagination=true
  stale_noop=true selection=true transactions=0 reopen=true`. The focused
  diagnosis suite has 13 tests, all 17 Assembly GUI lifecycle gates pass, and
  the complete SteveCAD suite is 3,206 passed with four intentional skips. Ruff,
  compileall, diff checks, source/build parity, and the SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are green. The protected
  Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases pass, and the Assembly
  VibeScript gate returns explicit `"ok": true` with every ordinary and coupled
  joint solver code zero. No VibeScript source changed; no FreeCAD process
  remains; the preserved recovery snapshot and lock are untouched; the prior
  test-created crash lock remains absent; and the immutable 5-axis fixture
  remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  At that checkpoint, `assembly.diagnose` remained intentionally incomplete
  pending row 11.24; Native mode remains globally unavailable until this
  entire plan is complete.
- Redundant-constraint diagnosis is an exact read-only
  `assembly.diagnose/select_redundant_constraints` operation mapped only from
  the live `Assembly_SelectRedundantConstraints` action. It consumes the same
  most-recent `getLastRedundant()` solver result selected by the human command;
  it does not invoke a solve or recompute, change selection, open a transaction,
  or mutate the document. Conflict and redundancy reads now share one bounded
  preflight/drift guard that verifies the exact human-active Assembly, timeline
  state, component and joint identities, diagnosis SHA-256 and counts, page,
  frozen turn, and human selection before returning. Category membership is
  independently reconstructed from the same native constraint specifications,
  residuals, and redundant flags, including the producer's intentional overlap
  between redundant and partially redundant sets. Success
  returns only exact joint references, labels/types, both semantic connectors
  and offsets, aggregate constraint/DoF evidence, concise solver health, and
  pagination state. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate creates two identical
  Fixed joints between one grounded and one moving component, proves native
  solver status `0`, proves only `FixedTwo` is redundant with all six of its six
  constraints redundant and zero degrees of freedom removed, and matches the
  exact human selection command. It also proves stale hash/count no-ops,
  unchanged selection/objects/placements/undo/transaction/edit state,
  idempotent replay, and FCStd save/close/reopen followed by a fresh compiled
  solve and read. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_REDUNDANT_DIAGNOSIS_GUI_OK components=2 joints=2
  redundant=1 solver_status=0 human_match=true complete_redundancy=true
  stale_noop=true selection=true transactions=0 reopen=true`. The combined
  conflict/redundancy diagnosis suite has 19 tests, all 18 Assembly GUI
  lifecycle gates pass, and the complete SteveCAD suite is 3,212 passed with
  four intentional skips. Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build parity,
  and the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases pass
  with final `"ok": true`, and the Assembly VibeScript gate exits zero with
  top-level `"ok": true` and every ordinary and coupled joint solver code zero.
  No VibeScript source changed; no FreeCAD process remains; the preserved
  recovery snapshot and lock are untouched; the prior test-created crash lock
  remains absent; and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  At that checkpoint, `assembly.diagnose` remained intentionally incomplete
  pending row 11.24; Native mode remains globally unavailable until this
  entire plan is complete.
- Partially redundant-constraint diagnosis is an exact read-only
  `assembly.diagnose/select_partially_redundant_constraints` operation mapped
  only from the live `Assembly_SelectPartiallyRedundantConstraints` action. It
  reads the same most-recent `getLastPartiallyRedundant()` set used by the human
  command without solving, recomputing, selecting, opening a transaction, or
  mutating the document. The shared exact diagnosis guard freezes and rechecks
  the active Assembly, timeline, object identities, diagnosis SHA-256 and
  counts, bounded page, turn, and human selection. Each returned joint proves
  that its redundant-constraint count is strictly between zero and its total
  constraint count, returns both semantic connectors and offsets plus aggregate
  constraint/DoF evidence, and explicitly reports whether it also belongs to
  the independently produced redundant set. This preserves the compiled
  producer's intentional category overlap and status priority instead of
  pretending the categories are disjoint. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI
  gate creates coincident Cylindrical and Slider joints between one grounded
  and one moving component. Cylindrical removes four DoF with zero redundant
  constraints; Slider then has five constraints, four redundant and one
  effective, appears in both redundancy sets, leaves one DoF, and is the exact
  sole selection of the human partial-redundancy command. The gate also proves
  stale hash/count no-ops, unchanged selection/objects/placements/undo/
  transaction/edit state, idempotent replay, and FCStd save/close/reopen
  followed by a fresh compiled solve and read. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_PARTIAL_REDUNDANCY_DIAGNOSIS_GUI_OK components=2
  joints=2 partial=1 redundant_overlap=1 solver_status=0 human_match=true
  aggregate=4_of_5 stale_noop=true selection=true transactions=0 reopen=true`.
  The combined diagnosis suite has 25 tests, all 19 Assembly GUI lifecycle
  gates pass, and the complete SteveCAD suite is 3,218 passed with four
  intentional skips. Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build parity, and
  the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases pass
  with final `"ok": true`, and the Assembly VibeScript gate exits zero with
  top-level `"ok": true` and every ordinary and coupled joint solver code zero.
  No VibeScript source changed; no FreeCAD process remains; the preserved
  recovery snapshot and lock are untouched; the prior test-created crash lock
  remains absent; and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  At that checkpoint, `assembly.diagnose` remained intentionally incomplete
  pending row 11.24; Native mode remains globally unavailable until this
  entire plan is complete.
- Malformed-constraint diagnosis is an exact read-only
  `assembly.diagnose/select_malformed_constraints` operation mapped only from
  the live `Assembly_SelectMalformedConstraints` action. It consumes the same
  most-recent `getLastMalformed()` result selected by the human command and
  does not solve, recompute, select, open a transaction, or mutate the
  document. The shared diagnosis guard freezes and rechecks the exact
  human-active Assembly, timeline, object identities, solver-placement and
  diagnosis SHA-256 values, category and graph counts, bounded page, turn, and
  human selection. Malformed joints must be absent from the native constraint
  rows because the compiled producer excludes them from the MbD graph; any
  overlapping, unknown, stale, duplicate, unbounded, connector-drifting, or
  selection-drifting state fails closed. Each result contains only the exact
  joint reference, label/type, both semantic connectors and offsets, the
  `same_solver_part_in_fixed_drag_bundle` reason, whether the joint is the
  Fixed bundle constraint itself or an extra intra-bundle constraint, and a
  role-specific corrective action. A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate
  creates three components with a grounded-to-moving Cylindrical joint, a
  Fixed joint between the two moving components, and a Slider across that same
  pair. A normal solve is clean; a real direct component drag then enters the
  compiled Fixed-bundle pre-drag solve, which safely omits the Fixed and Slider
  joints, leaves only the Cylindrical solver row, reports status `0`, and
  produces the exact two-joint malformed set. The gate cancels that real move
  through the supported selection-clear lifecycle, proves exact placement
  restoration and transaction abort while retaining the diagnosis, and
  matches Native's two bounded pages to the real human selection command. It
  also proves stale hash/count no-ops, unchanged selection/objects/placements/
  undo/transaction/edit state, idempotent replay, and FCStd save/close/reopen
  followed by another compiled drag diagnosis. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_MALFORMED_DIAGNOSIS_GUI_OK components=3 joints=3
  malformed=2 fixed_member=1 intra_bundle=1 solver_status=0 human_match=true
  pagination=true stale_noop=true selection=true transactions=0 reopen=true`.
  The combined diagnosis suite has 31 tests, all 20 Assembly GUI lifecycle
  gates pass, and the complete SteveCAD suite is 3,224 passed with four
  intentional skips. Ruff, compileall, diff checks, source/build parity, and
  the SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are
  green. The protected Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases
  pass with final `"ok": true`, and the Assembly VibeScript gate exits zero
  with top-level `"ok": true`, all 13 ordinary joint solver codes zero, and
  both coupled-joint solver codes zero. No VibeScript source changed; no
  FreeCAD or FreeCADCmd process remains; the preserved recovery snapshot and
  lock are untouched; the prior test-created crash lock remains absent; and
  the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  At that checkpoint, `assembly.diagnose` remained intentionally incomplete
  pending the remaining human Diagnose action in row 11.24; Native mode
  remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Joints-of-component reading is an exact read-only
  `assembly.diagnose/select_joints_of_component` operation mapped only from
  the live `Assembly_SelectJointsOfComponent` action. It targets one exact
  active movable component rather than changing or depending on human
  selection. The 568-line execution domain consumes the generated
  `AssemblyObject.Joints` Python property, which invokes the compiled
  `AssemblyObject::getJoints()` implementation used by
  `getJointsOfPart()`. Native therefore preserves compiled joint order and
  filtering for inactive, errored, suppressed, incomplete, self-referencing,
  and invalid-proxy joints instead of reconstructing that behavior in Python.
  Component eligibility is independently cross-checked through
  `UtilsAssembly.getMovablePartsWithin()` and
  `isMovableAssemblyComponent()`. A new concise Assemble
  `component_joint_state` exposes only availability, a SHA-256 digest, and
  component/joint counts. The digest covers exact Assembly, movable-component,
  and compiled-joint identities and order plus returned labels, types,
  component endpoints, connector paths, and offsets. Preflight and final
  verification freeze the active Assembly, target identity, counts, graph
  digest, bounded page, turn, and human selection. Stale, duplicate,
  cross-document, inactive, non-movable, unbounded, malformed-connector, or
  drifting state fails closed without a transaction. Success returns the
  target component, total graph and matching counts, pagination state, and
  for each matching joint its exact reference, label/type, whether the target
  occupies the first or second connector, the other component, and both exact
  connectors and offsets.
  A dispatcher-backed compiled GUI gate creates five components, three active
  joints attached to one target, and a fourth suppressed joint between that
  target and an otherwise unconnected component. It proves the exact Native
  order and set match the real human command invoked from an Assembly-rooted
  component subpath, proves the suppressed joint is excluded, checks both
  connector sides, two-page pagination, a zero-joint result, stale hash/count
  and wrong-target no-ops, unchanged selection/objects/placements/undo/
  transaction/edit state, idempotent replay, and FCStd save/close/reopen. It
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_COMPONENT_JOINTS_GUI_OK components=5
  joints=3 attached=3 suppressed_excluded=true human_match=true
  exact_sides=true pagination=true empty=true stale_noop=true selection=true
  transactions=0 reopen=true diagnose_complete=true`. The combined diagnosis
  suite has 38 tests, all 21 Assembly GUI lifecycle gates pass, and the
  complete SteveCAD suite is 3,231 passed with four intentional skips. Ruff,
  compileall, diff checks, source/build parity for touched files, and the
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets are green.
  The protected Sketcher gate exits zero, all 17 Part Design phases pass with
  exit zero, and the current-source Assembly VibeScript gate exits zero with
  top-level `"ok": true`, all 13 ordinary joint solver codes zero, and both
  coupled-joint solver codes zero. No VibeScript source changed. This fifth
  variant completes the shipped Assembly Diagnose ribbon family without
  exposing selection mutation, command dispatch, or workbench/ribbon control.
  No FreeCAD or FreeCADCmd process remains; the preserved recovery snapshot
  and lock are untouched; the prior test-created crash lock remains absent;
  and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native remains selectable only on complete ribbons; incomplete ribbons stay
  fail-closed.
- Assembly view creation is one exact mutating
  `assembly.structure/create_view` operation mapped only from the live
  `Assembly_CreateView` action on the human-selected Assemble ribbon. A new
  bounded view-state reader freezes the exact active Assembly, component
  count, finite Assembly bounds, both native movable-target inventories from
  `UtilsAssembly.getMovablePartsWithin()` (`individual_objects` and
  `parts_as_single_solid`), canonical Assembly-rooted selection paths, target
  placements and centers, the existing view/move graph, and a SHA-256 digest.
  Provider state exposes concise identities, counts, bounds, target-mode
  membership, and a bounded view preview; internal selection paths and the
  full durable graph are not echoed to the provider. The closed request schema
  requires that digest and every relevant count, one exact Assembly, one
  scope, and an ordered bounded sequence of normal placement transforms or
  positive radial distances against exact target references. Preflight
  rechecks the human-active Assembly and presentation, requires the human
  command's minimum of two components, resolves every identity into the
  requested native target inventory, rejects duplicate, stale, zero-effect,
  cross-scope, cross-root, non-finite, or unbounded requests, and preserves
  selection without opening the human task panel.
  Mutation uses the real `CommandCreateView` operation and step factories plus
  their `ExplodedView` and `ExplodedViewStep` view-provider proxies. It creates
  or reuses the native `Assembly::ViewGroup`, publishes every step as a
  resource of one operation, assigns the exact native `References`,
  `MoveType`, and `MovementTransform` properties, and finalizes the canonical
  resource-first/owner-last History block through
  `finalizeProvisionalTimelineOperationBlock()`. Before commit, every move is
  exercised through its real `applyStep()` implementation; every exact target
  must move and produce one native explosion line, after which all original
  Assembly placements are restored exactly and every move resource is hidden.
  Postcondition verification rechecks graph identity/order, proxies, History
  role/owner/editor metadata, view-group membership, accepted visibility,
  target inventories, bounds, prior views, human selection, active Assembly,
  movement presentation, and restored placements. The concise result contains
  only exact object identities, label/scope, counts, explosion-line count, the
  new view-state digest, and explicit preservation facts. One transaction,
  assistant-local undo, stale-state no-op behavior, and idempotent call replay
  remain owned by the shared Native mutation runtime.
  Repeated compiled save/reopen testing exposed a separate core lifecycle
  defect: `DocumentTimeline::normalizeAfterRestore()` preserved the correct
  `VisibilityAtEnd` bits but did not reapply them after Python-backed operation
  proxies completed their restore callbacks, so an arbitrary move could reopen
  visible. History now shares one end-state presentation reconciliation path
  between restore and undo/redo, applied after the complete object graph is
  reconstructed and while restore capture is suppressed. A deterministic
  Assembly core regression intentionally makes a Python resource visible in
  `onDocumentRestored()` and proves the accepted hidden state wins. The Native
  GUI gate asserts live and accepted visibility after each create, each redo,
  immediately before and after save, and after reopen. The unfixed build failed
  four of five repeated runs; the repaired build passed five of five and the
  final formatted build passed again. The gate also proves nested individual
  targets, single-solid scope, normal and radial moves, malformed and stale
  no-ops, exact task/edit/selection/presentation preservation, one-step
  undo/redo, view-group reuse, proxy/owner restoration, and baseline placements,
  reporting `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_VIEW_GUI_OK views=2 normal_moves=2
  radial_moves=1 nested_target=true stale_noop=true undo_redo=true reopen=true
  placements_restored=true`.
  All 22 compiled Native Assembly lifecycle gates pass against the rebuilt
  core, the focused view/structure/component suite has 19 passing tests, and
  the complete SteveCAD suite has 3,236 passing tests with four intentional
  skips. The new deterministic Assembly core test passes; the broader legacy
  `AssemblyTests.TestCore` module retains an independently reproducible,
  unrelated flexible-occurrence provisional-proof failure and was not hidden
  by changing production behavior or assertions. Ruff, formatting of every
  new file, compilation, diff checks, declared source/build parity, and the
  SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, FreeCADApp, FreeCADGui, Assembly, and
  AssemblyGui targets are green. The protected Sketcher VibeScript lifecycle
  passes, all 17 Part Design VibeScript phases pass, and the current-source
  Assembly VibeScript integration exits zero. No VibeScript source changed.
  No FreeCAD or FreeCADCmd process remains; the preserved recovery snapshot
  and lock are untouched; the prior test-created crash lock remains absent;
  and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Assembly simulation creation is one exact mutating
  `assembly.structure/create_simulation` operation mapped only from the live
  `Assembly_CreateSimulation` action on the human-selected Assemble ribbon.
  It authors the durable Simulation/Motion History graph only; solver-frame
  generation, playback, cancellation, and restoration remain the separate
  row 11.27 lifecycle. This boundary matches the human command and keeps
  document and GUI access on the main thread instead of pretending FreeCAD
  objects are safe to mutate in a worker.
  A bounded simulation-state reader freezes the exact human-active Assembly,
  complete component and grounding graph, active regular-joint connector and
  parameter records, solver-placement digest, eligible driveable joints,
  existing Simulation/Motion graph, and one canonical SHA-256 digest. It
  advertises only valid unsuppressed Revolute, Slider, and Cylindrical joints
  with exact live connectors, mapping them respectively to angular, linear,
  or both motion types. Provider state returns concise identities, labels,
  supported motion types, counts, and bounded previews rather than the full
  internal graph.
  The closed schema requires one exact Assembly, finite bounded simulation
  parameters, 1 through 256 ordered exact-joint motions, single-line formulas,
  and the frozen digest and relevant counts. Preflight re-resolves every
  target, rejects stale active state before mutation, requires two components,
  a valid ground, and at least one driveable joint, enforces native joint/type
  compatibility, permits the intentional angular-plus-linear pair on one
  Cylindrical joint, rejects duplicate joint/type pairs, and bounds planned
  output work to 10,000 intervals.
  Mutation uses the shipped `CommandCreateSimulation.Simulation`, `Motion`,
  `ViewProviderSimulation`, and `ViewProviderMotion` factories and
  `UtilsAssembly.getSimulationGroup()`. It sets the exact native property
  types and values, preserves requested motion order, marks every motion as a
  resource owned by its Simulation, and finalizes one canonical
  resource-first/owner-last History block. Postcondition verification proves
  object types and proxies, ownership, group order, accepted visibility,
  timeline editor metadata, prior-graph preservation, exact parameters,
  unchanged selection and active Assembly, unchanged component placements,
  and absence of stray objects. The concise result contains exact identities,
  counts, parameters, motion-to-joint mappings, the new state digest, and an
  explicit `kinematics_generated: false`. The shared mutation runtime provides
  one semantic undo step and idempotent call replay.
  The focused and complete SteveCAD suites pass, with 3,242 tests passing and
  four intentional skips. The compiled GUI lifecycle gate passed repeatedly
  and on the final source/build pair, reporting
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_SIMULATION_GUI_OK simulations=2 motions=3
  cylindrical_dual_motion=true kinematics_not_generated=true stale_noop=true
  idempotent=true undo_redo=true reopen=true placements_unchanged=true`.
  SteveCADScripts and AssemblyScripts build cleanly; Ruff, Python compilation,
  diff checks, source/build parity, the protected Sketcher and Part Design
  VibeScript lifecycles, and the current-source Assembly VibeScript integration
  are green. No VibeScript source changed. The preserved recovery cache and
  lock are untouched, the forbidden crash lock remains absent, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Assembly simulation playback is one exact presentation-only
  `assembly.simulation` capability with the complete `open`, `seek`, `step`,
  `play`, `pause`, and `close` lifecycle. The open variant maps only from the
  shipped Simulation History context action on the human-selected Assemble
  surface; the remaining variants map the controls of the player task panel.
  Every control requires the exact 32-character Native playback identifier and
  exact Simulation object, while open additionally requires the frozen
  Assembly simulation-state digest and one exact generated output-grid time.
  There is no command dispatcher, workbench switch, or legacy playback path.
  Open validates the active Assembly, native Simulation ownership, complete
  durable simulation graph, finite bounded grid, document size, recompute and
  transaction state, and absence of another task before routing through the
  shipped read-only `CommandCreateSimulation.openSimulation()` player. It
  captures the exact document graph, solver placements and locks, component
  and joint visibility, selection, camera pose/projection, and GUI dirty state
  before generation. Launch postconditions prove that at least two frames were
  generated without a durable graph, transaction, selection, or active-
  Assembly change. A cryptographically random session ID is retained only for
  the exact document and stable Qt form identity because the native task-dialog
  binding returns a fresh Python wrapper on each query.
  Seek and step pause before displaying one exact generated solver frame;
  forward and backward play use the shipped timer controls; pause stops that
  exact timer. Common state, view, and inspection reads remain available only
  while the exact Native-owned player is live. Mutations, save, undo, another
  task, a Sketch edit, unresolved edit state, and any non-Assembly edit remain
  blocked by runtime guards. Normal Assembly edit mode is intentionally not
  mistaken for a task panel, so the human-selected Assemble surface can start
  a turn. Close routes the shipped rejection lifecycle and then verifies the
  task is gone and the document graph, simulation records, placements and
  locks, visibility, selection, camera, and dirty state are restored. Human
  close and document teardown remove the exact registry entry immediately;
  an old form callback cannot remove a replacement session. Saving from the
  shipped player establishes a new clean close baseline even when playback
  opened over a dirty GUI document.
  The compiled GUI gate exercises the real Assembly solver and player and
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_PLAYBACK_GUI_OK generated=true seek=true
  step=true bidirectional=true pause=true mutation_blocked=true
  save_baseline=true dirty_save_clean=true manual_close=true idempotent=true
  restored=true selection_preserved=true`. All six pre-existing compiled
  saved-simulation/player lifecycle tests pass. The focused contract suite has
  27 passing tests, and the complete SteveCAD suite has 3,250 passing tests with
  four intentional skips. Strict Ruff checks, formatting, Python compilation,
  diff checks, source/build parity, and the SteveCADScripts and AssemblyScripts
  targets are green. The protected current-source Sketcher, Part Design, and
  Assembly VibeScript gates all exit zero; no VibeScript source changed. No
  FreeCAD, FreeCADCmd, pytest, or build process remains. The preserved recovery
  cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash lock remains absent, and
  the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Assembly BOM creation is one exact `assembly.structure/create_bom` mutation
  mapped only from the shipped `Assembly_CreateBom` action on the
  human-selected Assemble ribbon. A bounded BOM-state reader freezes the exact
  active Assembly, direct-component count, native `OutList` source traversal,
  link and link-element targets, occurrence ordering, mirroring and scale,
  supported scalar and quantity properties, existing BOM operations and
  tables, and one canonical SHA-256 digest. Provider state exposes concise
  counts, supported built-in columns, bounded `.PropertyName` choices, existing
  BOM settings, and table sizes without returning the complete source graph or
  cell contents.
  The closed schema requires one exact Assembly, 1 through 32 unique ordered
  printable columns, the three native traversal flags, and the frozen digest,
  component count, and BOM count. Preflight re-resolves the human-active
  Assembly, rejects stale state before mutation, requires at least one active
  component, and enforces explicit source, property, operation, row, and cell
  bounds. Mutation uses the shipped `CommandCreateBom.createBomFeature()`
  factory and the real `Assembly::BomObject` and `Assembly::BomGroup` types,
  applies the exact native columns and settings, and generates the table in one
  immediate document transaction without opening a task panel or spreadsheet
  view. It preserves the human command's History behavior: the core enrolls
  the BOM in History, and Native does not invent a `SteveCADTimelineRole` that
  the human factory does not create.
  Postconditions prove the exact Assembly owner and BOM-group order, accepted
  and active History state, ordered table headers, bounded table digest and
  preview, unchanged active Assembly and selection, unchanged source graph and
  solver placements, prior-BOM preservation, and absence of stray document
  objects. The shared mutation runtime provides one-step undo/redo and
  idempotent same-call replay. The compiled lifecycle gate exercises property
  columns, quantity aggregation across duplicate links, nested detail,
  parts-only filtering, group reuse, stale no-op, replay, undo/redo, save and
  reopen, ownership, and unchanged placements, reporting
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_BOM_GUI_OK boms=2 rows=4 properties=true
  quantity_aggregation=true parts_filter=true stale_noop=true idempotent=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true owner=true no_sheet_opened=true
  placements_unchanged=true`.
  The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,256 passing tests and four intentional
  skips; the focused contract suite, targeted core BOM test, SteveCADScripts,
  AssemblyScripts, FreeCADApp, FreeCADGui, Assembly, and AssemblyGui targets,
  Ruff, formatting, Python compilation, diff checks, and declared source/build
  parity are green. The protected current-source Sketcher, Part Design, and
  Assembly VibeScript gates all exit zero, and no VibeScript source changed.
  The preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash
  lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis
  fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Linked-source selection is one exact read-only
  `assembly.inspect/linked_source` operation mapped to the shipped
  `Assembly_LinkSelectLinked` command exposed by the Assembly menu and
  AssemblyLink tree context menu. The context-action manifest now models
  primary read operations with `none` transaction behavior explicitly; it
  does not misclassify this action as a mutation or synthesize a ribbon button.
  The closed schema accepts only one exact current-document AssemblyLink name.
  Runtime reauthorizes the frozen Assemble turn, resolves that exact live
  `Assembly::AssemblyLink`, requires it to be the sole global human selection,
  preserves any selected subelement names, requires both the occurrence and
  linked `Assembly::AssemblyObject` to be active at their documents' current
  History positions, and resolves the same native `LinkedObject` relationship
  consumed by the C++ command. It reauthorizes again and verifies the global
  selection, target and source document graphs, object identities, active
  document, ribbon, edit state, and task state did not change. It never runs a
  command, activates a document, selects the source, or changes an MDI view.
  The concise result returns exact occurrence and source document UIDs, names,
  object IDs, types and bounded labels, external-document and rigid/flexible
  facts, selected subelements, and explicit preservation facts.
  The compiled GUI gate saves and reopens a real cross-document
  `Assembly::AssemblyLink`, proves the shipped human command selects the source
  and navigates to its document, then proves Native returns that identical
  source while preserving active document, MDI subwindow, selection, task/edit
  state, touched state, transactions, undo history, and both document graphs.
  Zero- and multi-selection calls fail without mutation. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_LINKED_SOURCE_GUI_OK human_navigation=true
  external=true read_only=true exact_selection=true stale_noop=true
  reopen=true selection_unchanged=true active_document_unchanged=true`.
  The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,264 passing tests and four intentional
  skips; the focused manifest, registry, schema and runtime suite has 79
  passing tests. SteveCADScripts, Ruff, new-file formatting, Python compilation, diff
  checks, and declared source/build parity are green. The protected
  current-source Sketcher gate, all 17 Part Design phases, and Assembly
  VibeScript integration pass; no VibeScript source changed. The preserved
  recovery cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash lock remains
  absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains
  exactly `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- ASMT export is one exact `assembly.export/asmt` output operation mapped only
  from the shipped `Assembly_ExportASMT` Assembly-menu action on the
  human-selected Assemble surface. The provider request contains the exact
  human-active Assembly reference plus its frozen diagnosis-state digest and
  component, ground, and joint counts; it contains no path, directory, file,
  or destination field. Preflight rejects an open transaction or recompute,
  re-resolves the exact active `Assembly::AssemblyObject`, and freezes the
  document graph, selection, undo position, transaction state, and GUI dirty
  state before SteveCAD asks the human to choose a destination.
  A new shared Native output boundary creates one trusted, bounded output
  request and accepts one exact path only from a main-thread save dialog. The
  resulting grant is request-bound and one-shot. It validates the suffix,
  parent-directory identity, and destination type and identity, and rejects
  cancellation, symlinks, directories, nonexistent parents, reuse, or drift.
  The real compiled `AssemblyObject.exportAsASMT()` serializer writes only to
  a private sibling temporary file. SteveCAD validates the ASMT header, bounds
  and hashes the complete output, reauthorizes the frozen turn and unchanged
  Assembly/document/UI state before and after serialization, then atomically
  publishes with `os.replace`. A failed serializer, stale turn, changed
  destination, or changed Assembly leaves the authorized destination intact.
  The concise result returns the Assembly identity, destination basename,
  byte count, SHA-256 digest, replacement fact, source-state digest, and
  explicit preservation facts; neither the provider request nor result
  reveals the human's filesystem path.
  The compiled GUI lifecycle gate exercises the shipped C++ serializer and
  reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_ASMT_EXPORT_GUI_OK human_serializer=true
  explicit_path=true provider_path_refused=true cancel_noop=true
  destination_drift_noop=true stale_noop=true atomic_overwrite=true
  idempotent=true document_unchanged=true selection_unchanged=true reopen=true`.
  The focused output/export suite has 15 passing tests and the complete
  SteveCAD suite has 3,279 passing tests with four intentional skips.
  SteveCADScripts, Ruff, formatting, Python compilation, diff checks, declared
  source/build parity, and the compiled GUI gate are green. The protected
  current-source Sketcher lifecycle, all 17 Part Design VibeScript phases, and
  Assembly VibeScript integration pass; no VibeScript source changed. The
  preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash lock
  remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture
  remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Assemble-ribbon standard-fastener insertion is one exact
  `assembly.fastener/insert_standard_fastener` mutation mapped only from the
  shipped `SteveCAD_InsertStandardFastener` action on the human-selected
  Assemble surface. It is intentionally separate from the retained Model
  fastener graph: the shared `model.catalog/fasteners` read is available on
  both Model and Assemble, while insertion creates the same native Assembly
  graph as the human command—a hidden catalog-backed `Part::FeaturePython`
  definition and one visible `App::Link` occurrence inside the unchanged
  human-active `Assembly::AssemblyObject`.
  The human command and Native runtime use one shared graph factory and
  validator, so their object types, generated solid, catalog identity, link
  target, tree presentation, and History semantics cannot drift. The hidden
  definition is the occurrence-owned History resource and immediately
  precedes the visible occurrence operation; the occurrence retains the
  shipped edit command and exact hidden editor link. Its local operation
  metadata is established before linking so an App::Link cannot forward the
  definition's owner property and falsely appear self-owned.
  The closed provider schema accepts only one exact active Assembly reference,
  printable label, exact catalog constructor, and frozen diagnosis-state
  digest plus component, ground, and joint counts. It exposes no placement,
  fuzzy target, workbench, command-dispatch, or filesystem authority.
  Preflight resolves and rechecks the human-active Assembly, exact catalog
  choice, document graph, selection, History operations, visibility state,
  component graph, joint graph, and solver placements before mutation.
  Postconditions prove the two-object creation boundary, exact source-then-
  occurrence History append, single-solid source/link equivalence, identity
  initial placement, unchanged active Assembly and selection, unchanged prior
  placements and joints, no stray objects, and a new exact diagnosis digest.
  Concise Assembly state identifies modern occurrences with a bounded
  `standard_fastener` record and exact hidden source reference.
  The compiled lifecycle gate exercises the shipped human command and Native
  parity, schema rejection, stale digest and count no-ops, invalid catalog
  rejection, forced verifier rollback, idempotent same-call replay, one-step
  undo/redo, tree and History presentation, snapshot continuity, placement
  preservation, and save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_FASTENER_GUI_OK human_parity=true
  hidden_definition=true visible_occurrence=true exact_history=true
  stale_noop=true invalid_catalog_noop=true rollback=true idempotent=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true snapshot=true placements_unchanged=true`.
  The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,285 passing tests with four intentional
  skips; the focused registry, manifest, catalog, schema, and runtime suite has
  55 passing tests. SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui
  build cleanly; strict Ruff checks, formatting, Python compilation, diff
  checks, and declared source/build parity are green. The protected
  current-source Sketcher lifecycle, all 17 Part Design VibeScript phases, and
  Assembly VibeScript integration exit zero; no VibeScript source changed.
  The preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash
  lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis
  fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Assemble-ribbon standard-fastener editing is the second typed
  `assembly.fastener` variant and is mapped only from the shipped
  `SteveCAD_EditStandardFastener` action on the human-selected Assemble
  surface. The closed provider request names the exact active Assembly,
  selected visible occurrence, hidden definition source, replacement catalog
  constructor, printable label, current per-fastener SHA-256 state, and frozen
  Assembly diagnosis digest and counts. It exposes no placement, workbench,
  command-dispatch, filesystem, or fuzzy-target authority.
  The modern human command and Native runtime now converge on one shared
  in-place graph editor. Preflight requires the requested occurrence to be the
  sole human selection, re-resolves its exact hidden source, rejects stale
  fastener or Assembly state and incompatible standards, and proves the source
  is owned by exactly that occurrence rather than shared through another link.
  Mutation retains the Assembly, occurrence, and source identities and changes
  only the source definition and visible occurrence label. Postconditions prove
  unchanged document object membership, source-then-occurrence History order
  and presentation, active Assembly, selection, components, joints, placement
  locks, and every existing component placement. The concise result returns
  only the exact graph references, new catalog identity and per-fastener state
  digest, solid/volume evidence, Assembly counts and digest, and the normal
  bounded receipt.
  The expanded compiled lifecycle gate drives the actual human insertion and
  edit command before exercising Native. It proves human/Native geometry and
  graph parity, exact selected-target and hidden-source enforcement,
  incompatible-standard and manually shared-definition guards, stale and
  malformed no-ops, forced-verifier rollback, identity-preserving edit,
  idempotent same-call replay, one-step undo/redo, snapshot continuation,
  placement preservation, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_FASTENER_GUI_OK human_parity=true
  hidden_definition=true visible_occurrence=true exact_history=true
  edit_in_place=true exact_selected_target=true compatible_guard=true
  shared_definition_guard=true stale_noop=true invalid_catalog_noop=true
  rollback=true idempotent=true undo_redo=true reopen=true snapshot=true
  placements_unchanged=true`.
  The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,287 passing tests with four intentional
  skips; the focused fastener, catalog, registry, and manifest suite has 109
  passing tests. SteveCADScripts, AssemblyScripts, Assembly, and AssemblyGui
  build cleanly; strict Ruff checks, Python compilation, diff checks, and
  declared source/build parity are green. The protected current-source
  Sketcher lifecycle, all 17 Part Design VibeScript phases, and Assembly
  VibeScript integration exit zero; no VibeScript source changed. Native mode
  remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- The conditional Assemble matching-hole and fastener-attachment rows require
  no Assemble provider operation on the current product. The authoritative
  live manifest contains 53 Assemble actions and exposes only Insert and Edit
  in its Standard Components group; `SteveCAD_CreateMatchingFastenerHole` and
  `SteveCAD_AttachStandardFastener` are Model-only actions, and the shipped
  human matching-hole command explicitly requires `PartDesignWorkbench`.
  Existing Model rows 9.65 and 9.66 already provide their exact-target Native
  implementations on the Model surface. Mapping either action into Assemble
  would create AI-only cross-ribbon authority, so rows 11.33 and 11.34 are
  satisfied by deliberate absence rather than duplicate tools. The context
  manifest test proves there is no hidden fastener context action and that the
  intersection of the four fastener actions with Assemble is exactly Insert
  and Edit. The compiled live-surface gate confirms Assemble remains the exact
  53-action shipped graph and reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_RIBBON_SURFACE_GUI_OK`;
  the focused action/context-manifest suite has 54 passing tests. Any future
  addition of either command to the shipped Assemble graph will fail manifest
  parity and require a new Assemble-scoped implementation before Native can be
  enabled there.
- Assemble Robot creation is one exact `robot.setup/create` mutation mapped
  only from the shipped `Robot_Create` action on the human-selected Assemble
  surface. The closed provider schema accepts a printable label plus the exact
  frozen Robot-state digest and count; it contains no path, directory, file,
  command-dispatch, workbench-switching, or fuzzy-target field. A shared Native
  input boundary asks the human through a host-owned existing-file dialog and
  turns each selected VRML or CSV file into a request-bound, one-shot grant.
  The grant rejects invalid suffixes, nonregular files, oversized content,
  symlink/identity drift, reuse, and modification before or during its
  descriptor-based read. Provider-visible summaries contain only the basename,
  byte count, and SHA-256 digest.
  Preflight proves the exact Robot graph, document object identities, History,
  selection, transaction, and recompute state before either dialog and rechecks
  them after both human choices. VRML must have a version 1.0 or 2.0 header;
  kinematics must be UTF-8 CSV with one header and exactly six eight-value axis
  rows, finite values, direction `-1` or `1`, ordered limits, and positive
  velocity. One transaction creates the native `Robot::RobotObject`, embeds the
  two authorized definitions, installs the validated six-axis kinematics, and
  publishes exactly one final History operation while preserving the human
  selection and every prior Robot.
  Assemble context now exposes bounded, path-free Robot setup state with exact
  object, definition-content, axes, home, Base, Tool, ToolBase, TCP, ToolShape,
  validity, suppression, History, and presentation records plus per-Robot and
  whole-setup SHA-256 digests. Signed zero and only the sub-picometre placement
  tail beyond FCStd storage precision are canonicalized so unchanged Robot
  digests survive ordinary save/reopen. The shared
  Robot object now synchronizes its durable public `Tcp` property immediately
  when `RobotKinematicFile` loads, fixing a real human-command persistence
  defect found by parity testing; the upstream Robot GUI lifecycle test proves
  the expected TCP before and after reopen.
  The compiled lifecycle gate exercises the shipped human Robot command and
  Native parity, path-free provider schema, human input authority, exact state
  and History, malformed-file and input-drift no-ops, stale-state rejection,
  cancellation, forced-verifier rollback, idempotent same-call replay, one-step
  undo/redo, selection preservation, and FCStd save/reopen. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_SETUP_GUI_OK human_parity=true
  human_input_authority=true provider_paths=false exact_history=true
  exact_state=true malformed_noop=true input_drift_noop=true stale_noop=true
  cancel_noop=true rollback=true idempotent=true undo_redo=true reopen=true
  selection_preserved=true`. The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,301 passing tests
  with four intentional skips; the focused input/setup suite has 14 passing
  tests. Robot, RobotGui, RobotScripts, and SteveCADScripts build cleanly; Ruff,
  formatting, Python compilation, diff checks, and declared source/build parity
  are green. The protected current-source Sketcher lifecycle, all 17 Part Design
  VibeScript phases, and Assembly VibeScript integration exit zero; no VibeScript
  production source changed. The preserved recovery cache and lock are
  untouched, the forbidden crash lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process
  remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Robot tool and waypoint configuration now complete the remaining shipped
  `robot.setup` actions for row 11.36 without granting the provider selection,
  command-dispatch, workbench-switching, filesystem-path, or document-lifecycle
  authority. `Robot_AddToolShape` accepts one exact active-document Robot and
  one exact Part feature or embedded VRML object, each with its frozen state
  digest. Preflight rejects open transactions, pending recompute, stale Robot
  setup, stale target identity, changed Part `Shape.Tag`, and changed VRML
  content before opening one exact document transaction. Mutation changes only
  the Robot's `ToolShape` link, recomputes only that Robot, preserves object
  identities, selection, and History, and returns one normal receipt naming the
  changed Robot. A link that is already exact is a verified no-op with no
  transaction, receipt, revision, or undo entry.
  Assemble state exposes a bounded path-free tool inventory with exact object,
  placement, kind, and stale-state digests. Part discovery deliberately uses
  FreeCAD's durable shape tag instead of validating or serializing every BREP;
  the immutable 5-axis fixture's 53 candidates take 0.009 seconds rather than
  the rejected eager-BREP design's 3.84 seconds. Embedded VRML records retain a
  content SHA-256 because `PropertyFileIncluded` cache files are rewritten on
  reopen even when their content is unchanged. The final chosen target is
  re-read after mutation, so content or identity drift cannot be hidden by the
  concise inventory.
  `Robot_SetDefaultOrientation` and `Robot_SetDefaultValues` are modeled as the
  application-session operations the shipped commands actually are. Their
  schemas use explicit millimetres, degrees, millimetres per second, and
  millimetres per second squared plus the frozen waypoint-default digest. They
  update only RobotGui's five process globals, produce no Native document
  receipt or structural revision, create no transaction or undo entry, and do
  not dirty or serialize the FCStd. The boundary verifier freezes document
  objects, selection, History, undo count, transaction state, and Native
  revision; any mismatch restores only values still owned by the failed call.
  Assemble state identifies these defaults as non-durable application-session
  state so the provider cannot mistake them for document properties.
  The new compiled lifecycle gate drives all three shipped human commands and
  then Native Part, embedded-VRML, orientation, and motion-default operations.
  It proves human semantic parity, path-free state, exact target and content
  drift rejection, stale-state no-ops, forced-verifier rollback, same-call
  replay, verified no-op, one-step undo/redo, selection preservation, no
  document bytes from session defaults, defaults rollback, and FCStd
  save/reopen with Part and VRML state stability. It reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_CONFIGURATION_GUI_OK human_tool_parity=true
  exact_targets=true tool_drift_noop=true stale_noop=true rollback=true
  idempotent=true undo_redo=true reopen=true vrml=true
  human_defaults_parity=true session_only=true document_unchanged=true
  defaults_rollback=true selection_preserved=true`. The pre-existing Robot
  creation gate and all 13 shipped Robot GUI lifecycle tests remain green.
  The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,304 passing tests with four intentional
  skips; the focused registry, manifest, snapshot, input, and Robot suite has 78
  passing tests. Robot, RobotGui, RobotScripts, and SteveCADScripts build cleanly;
  Ruff, Python compilation, diff checks, and declared source/build parity are
  green. The protected current-source Sketcher lifecycle, all 17
  Part Design VibeScript phases, and Assembly VibeScript integration exit zero;
  no VibeScript production source changed. The four execution modules are 376,
  172, 325, and 193 lines, and the compiled gate is 616 lines, all below the
  1,000-line ceiling. The preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the
  forbidden crash lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Robot trajectory creation and the two shipped waypoint insertion paths now
  complete row 11.37 without granting the provider GUI preselection, mouse,
  command-dispatch, workbench-switching, filesystem-path, or document-lifecycle
  authority. The `robot.trajectory` capability has three closed variants for
  `Robot_CreateTrajectory`, `Robot_InsertWaypoint`, and
  `Robot_InsertWaypointPreselect`; the latter is represented by the exact
  persisted world-space point rather than hidden access to transient GUI
  preselection. Robot-derived waypoints reproduce the shipped command's
  `Tcp.multiply(Tool)` placement, while position waypoints use the frozen
  orientation, displacement, velocity, and acceleration defaults that the
  human command consumes.
  Assemble context now exposes a bounded, path-free Robot trajectory inventory
  with exact object identity, Base reference, History, validity, suppression,
  presentation, waypoint indices and names, type, placement, motion parameters,
  tool/base numbers, per-waypoint digests, per-trajectory digests, and one
  global digest. The reader admits at most 256 trajectory objects, publishes at
  most 16 concise trajectory summaries and four representative waypoint
  summaries per trajectory, accepts at most 4,096 waypoints in one trajectory,
  and stops immediately at the 16,384-waypoint document bound rather than
  scanning an unbounded remainder on the UI thread.
  Every mutation freezes the active document, exact trajectory and Robot state,
  and waypoint defaults before opening one transaction. Creation publishes one
  final History operation. Insertion edits only the exact trajectory, preserves
  every existing object and History record, and verifies the exact new
  waypoint. Stale trajectory, Robot, or default state fails before mutation;
  verifier failure rolls back; and same-call replay is idempotent at the shared
  dispatcher/state boundary.
  The compiled lifecycle gate drives all three shipped human commands and their
  Native equivalents and reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_TRAJECTORY_GUI_OK human_create_parity=true
  exact_history=true exact_targets=true human_robot_waypoint_parity=true

  stale_trajectory_noop=true stale_robot_noop=true stale_defaults_noop=true
  rollback=true idempotent=true undo_redo=true reopen=true
  selection_preserved=true`. The existing Robot setup and configuration gates
  remain green, as do all 13 shipped Robot GUI tests. The complete SteveCAD suite
  has 3,308 passing tests with four intentional skips; the focused trajectory,
  registry, manifest, capability, setup, and snapshot suite has 92 passing
  tests. SteveCADScripts, RobotScripts, Robot, and RobotGui build cleanly; Ruff,
  Python compilation, diff checks, and declared source/build parity are green.
  The protected current-source Sketcher, Part Design, and Assembly VibeScript
  lifecycles exit zero with Part Design reporting `"ok": true`; no VibeScript
  production source changed. The five execution/state modules are 770, 43, 108,
  138, and 345 lines, and the compiled gate is 492 lines, all below the
  1,000-line ceiling. The preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the
  forbidden crash lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the
  immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete;
  row 11.38 will add the remaining edge, dress-up, and compound trajectory
  actions before the Assemble surface can be complete.
- Robot edge, dress-up, and compound trajectory authoring now completes row
  11.38 through three additional exact variants of `robot.trajectory` on both
  the Assemble and Manufacture surfaces: `edge2_trac` for
  `Robot_Edge2Trac`, `trajectory_dress_up` for
  `Robot_TrajectoryDressUp`, and `trajectory_compound` for
  `Robot_TrajectoryCompound`. The schemas distinguish create from edit,
  require exact target and source digests for edits, and never expose GUI
  preselection, command dispatch, workbench switching, filesystem paths, or
  document lifecycle controls.
  Edge trajectories accept exact Part-object `EdgeN` references, line,
  B-spline, and circle shape tags, segmentation, and rotation while bounding
  generated output at 4,096 waypoints. Dress-up trajectories freeze the exact
  source, speed, acceleration, continuity, and placement semantics and predict
  the C++ feature's float32 waypoint output before mutation. Compound
  trajectories require an ordered unique source list, reject cycles, reproduce
  the shipped feature's ASCII name sanitation and uniqueness rules, and reject
  empty or over-bounded output. All three freeze the global trajectory state,
  exact source state, target state, History, and presentation inputs; stale,
  cyclic, invalid, and already-equal calls are transaction-free no-ops. A real
  mutation uses one transaction and one History operation, then reconciles the
  result and replaced-source visibility with the same owner-chain semantics as
  RobotGui, including sources still replaced by another active modifier.
  Assemble state now includes the exact feature controls and usable History
  positions. Manufacture state adds bounded `robot_tool_shapes` and
  `robot_trajectories` inventories so the same actions retain exact targeting
  without a second state contract.
  The compiled lifecycle gate drives the three shipped human commands and the
  Native equivalents and reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_TRAJECTORY_FEATURES_GUI_OK human_edge_parity=true
  human_dress_up_parity=true human_compound_parity=true exact_history=true
  exact_targets=true manufacture_surface=true stale_noop=true cycle_noop=true
  bounded=true rollback=true verified_noop=true idempotent=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true selection_preserved=true`. The preceding Robot creation,
  configuration, and trajectory gates remain green, as do all 13 shipped Robot
  GUI tests. The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,312 passing tests with four
  intentional skips; the focused trajectory, setup, registry, manifest,
  capability, and snapshot suite has 96 passing tests. SteveCADScripts,
  RobotScripts, Robot, and RobotGui build cleanly; Ruff, Python compilation,
  diff checks, and declared source/build parity are green. The protected
  current-source Sketcher, all 17 Part Design phases, Assembly, and Robot
  VibeScript lifecycles exit zero with their structured success markers. The
  Robot gate's stale exact surface expectation was updated to include the four
  focused read/delete tools already present on the current VibeScript surface;
  no VibeScript production source changed. The split feature-spec,
  presentation, execution, and dispatch modules are 376, 101, 944, and 210
  lines, and the compiled gate is 863 lines, all below the 1,000-line ceiling.
  The preserved recovery cache and lock are untouched, the forbidden crash
  lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process remains, and the immutable 5-axis
  fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  Native mode remains globally unavailable until this entire plan is complete.
- Robot home capture, home restoration, and preview-only simulation now share
  the exact `robot.motion` capability with three action-specific variants.
  Set Home freezes the complete Robot setup and exact Robot digest, predicts
  the six float32 values stored by the shipped property, changes only `Home`,
  and produces one verified transaction receipt. Restore Home requires an
  exact six-axis stored home, changes only the six axes and derived TCP in one
  transaction, and verifies every unrelated Robot record. Both variants reject
  stale targets before mutation, return transaction-free verified no-ops, roll
  back failed postconditions, retain provider-call idempotency, and preserve
  human selection, History, undo/redo, and save/reopen semantics.
  Simulation freezes the exact Robot, trajectory, global Robot and trajectory
  digests, document boundary, and an explicitly ordered list of 1-64 float32
  sample times. It returns bounded joint, TCP, path-target, and velocity samples
  without a transaction, receipt, undo entry, task dialog, document revision,
  or durable object change. The initial implementation exposed a genuine host
  integration defect: calling `Trajectory.position()` on the Python property
  copy emitted a false structural `Trajectory` notification. The final path is
  the additive Robot-module `previewTrajectorySamples` boundary, which reads
  the document property through the same const C++ path as the human command,
  copies the Robot kinematic model, uses the shipped `Simulation` float-time and
  tool semantics, and never mutates either document object. The post-evaluation
  revision guard remains intact rather than suppressing observer safety. The
  action manifest now classifies this bounded preview as session work rather
  than a background document mutation; the live production resolver confirms
  `robot.motion` is no longer missing or incomplete on either ribbon.
  Assemble and Manufacture state now include the bounded Robot setup needed for
  exact simulation targeting. The compiled lifecycle gate drives the three
  shipped human commands and their Native variants and reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_MOTION_GUI_OK human_set_home_parity=true
  human_restore_home_parity=true human_simulation_parity=true
  exact_targets=true stale_noop=true rollback=true verified_noop=true
  idempotent=true undo_redo=true preview_only=true manufacture_surface=true
  reopen=true selection_preserved=true`. All five Native Robot compiled gates
  and all 13 shipped Robot GUI tests are green. The complete SteveCAD suite has
  3,317 passing tests with four intentional skips; the focused motion,
  registry, manifest, capability, and snapshot suite has 82 passing tests.
  SteveCADScripts, RobotScripts, Robot, and RobotGui build cleanly; Ruff, Python
  compilation, diff checks, and declared source/build parity are green. The
  protected current-source Sketcher lifecycle, all 17 Part Design phases,
  Assembly, and Robot VibeScript lifecycles exit zero with their success
  markers, and no VibeScript production source changed. The split motion,
  binding, runtime, and schema modules are 649, 43, 122, and 123 lines; the
  compiled gate is 574 lines. The production ribbon gate also confirms Model
  and contextual Sketch are complete, selectable 19- and 10-tool Native
  surfaces while incomplete ribbons remain fail-closed. The authoring-mode GUI
  gate now uses that real production resolver without an availability stub and
  proves the human can select Native on Model; the full Codex thread gate then
  creates an exact Sketch line through the frozen provider surface on the GUI
  thread. The preserved recovery cache and lock are
  untouched, the forbidden crash lock remains absent, no FreeCAD process
  remains, and the immutable 5-axis fixture remains exactly
  `19a445d49a18b6cd997e51eadd2c0c8f89eca29533281e2015601874c0f58cbe`.
  At that checkpoint row 11.40 remained next; the completed Assemble closure
  is recorded below.
- The compact Sketch provider contract now carries the exact `sketch-v1` hash
  at the top level of the turn-start active-domain state, matching the revision
  required by every subsequent Sketch mutation. Runtime and published schemas
  share one limits module: atomic batches accept and advertise up to 32
  geometry elements and 128 feasible constraints, while inspect advertises its
  exact 1-48 page-size bound and default. Batch origin references normalize
  both `{origin:true}` and `{origin:true,position:"point"}` without inventing
  durable local-ref state. Coincident now distinguishes coordinates that
  already overlap from an actual persistent constraint and lets Sketcher's
  feasibility diagnosis decide whether the exact constraint can be added.
  Redundant size requests on a semicircular arc return a structured
  `sketch.dimension/constrain_angle` repair for the `circular_arc_span` form,
  including the current revision. Captured pixels travel exactly once through
  Codex's typed `inputImage.imageUrl` dynamic-tool content item; provider text
  contains only bounded JSON metadata and rejects any embedded data URL.
  The compiled production gate reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_SKETCH_PROVIDER_SURFACE_GUI_OK tools=27 schemas=47616B
  turn_revision batch128 origin coincidence repair typed_capture delete leave
  diagnostics`. The complete SteveCAD suite has 3,331 passing tests with four
  intentional skips; SteveCADScripts builds cleanly and the focused corrected
  contract set has 58 passing tests. VibeScript production source remains
  unchanged.
- The human-selected 53-action Assemble ribbon now resolves as one complete
  production Native surface with 17 focused provider tools and 61,325 bytes of
  canonical schemas. Resolution reports no missing definitions, missing
  implementations, or incomplete families. `component.interface` publishes
  exact document/object IDs through the real production turn, while
  `AssemblyContextToggleActive` remains explicitly human-only and no Native
  operation can change the active Assembly or ribbon.
  Bounded Assemble state now reports exact component, joint, Assembly, linked
  source, and active-Assembly identities; rigid/flexible mode; grounding;
  concise solver status, remaining degrees of freedom, tolerance, maximum
  residual, and bounded conflict summaries; truncation markers; and one
  structural digest. The digest includes `AssemblyLink.Rigid`, so a conversion
  invalidates stale calls without requiring the assistant to reconstruct prior
  tool history. Normal results contain exact targets, outcome counts, state
  digest, and one mutation receipt rather than raw solver or document dumps.
  Exact-target `make_rigid` and `make_flexible` use the native `AssemblyLink`
  lifecycle in one owned transaction. History verification now follows the
  real `DocumentTimeline` contract: it compares semantic operation blocks,
  preserves every unrelated block and root order exactly, and permits only the
  selected link's native resource reconciliation plus predicted incompatible
  grounding deletion. The same correction is applied to the human context
  action, so owned joint-group creation or retirement is not misclassified as
  insertion or deletion of an unrelated user operation.
  The compiled production structure gate reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ASSEMBLY_STRUCTURE_GUI_OK actions=53 tools=17
  schemas=61325B assemblies=2 components=4 transactions=8
  rigid_flexible=true grounding_cleanup=true active_read=true`; it also proves
  stale-state rejection, idempotent replay, undo/redo, save/reopen, selection
  preservation, exact resource ownership, and the human-only Active control.
  The production component-interface gate reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_COMPONENT_INTERFACE_GUI_OK`. Representative real-GUI gates
  independently pass insert/ground/revolute-joint/solve/BOM/simulation
  workflows, including stale no-ops, undo/redo, and reopen where applicable.
  The focused manifest, context, Assemble, registry, session, capability, and
  common-read suite has 103 passing tests; Ruff and Python compilation are
  clean, and `AssemblyGui` plus `SteveCADScripts` build cleanly. No VibeScript
  production source changed. Assemble is therefore enabled as a complete
  Native surface while unfinished ribbons continue to fail closed.
- The Assembly joint runtime has been split by responsibility without changing
  its public provider contract: the dispatcher is 228 lines, shared argument
  decoding is 158 lines, motion-joint execution is 440 lines, and
  relation-joint execution is 598 lines. The Angle contract is 229 lines, the
  Rack-and-Pinion contract is 350 lines, the shared coupled-joint geometry
  layer is 194 lines, the Screw contract is 345 lines, the shared rotational
  coupling engine is 373 lines, and the Gears and Belt contracts are 170 lines
  each. Every execution module remains below the 1,000-line ceiling.
- The 1,405-line action inventory remains declarative rather than accumulating
  domain execution logic. New domain modules are split before they approach
  1,000 lines.

## Non-negotiable product rules

- The human alone changes ribbons and workbenches.
- The assistant has no workbench activation, ribbon activation, command-search,
  or arbitrary `runCommand` capability.
- The active provider surface is derived from the visible SteveCAD ribbon and
  contextual edit state, not from historical FreeCAD workbench-pack names.
- A human ribbon change invalidates the current assistant turn before another
  mutation can run.
- SteveCAD does not automatically continue an assistant turn after a surface
  change. The human resumes from the new surface.
- Tools cannot invoke a different surface as a hidden side effect.
- Human selection may provide exact targets, but labels and selection order are
  never silently guessed.
- Every mutation is one closed transaction and one coherent undo step.
- Expensive operations never block the UI thread.
- Normal provider results are concise and contain only information useful for
  deciding or verifying the next operation.
- Full diagnostics belong in debug logging, not normal tool results.
- VibeScript source remains authoritative for VibeScript-owned documents.
- Visibility, selection, tree expansion, and camera changes are presentation
  state and never count as VibeScript source overrides.
- Native mode does not attempt to backpropagate mutations into VibeScript.
- No partial Native mode is presented as finished to users.
- Runtime implementation must stay split by responsibility and ribbon/domain.
  Shared registries may describe contracts, but they may not accumulate domain
  execution logic; capability implementations and tests must be split before a
  source file becomes a multi-thousand-line monolith.

## Fixed surface scope

The current maximum ribbon inventory is:

| Human surface | Actions, including dropdown children and shared actions |
|---|---:|
| Model | 75 |
| Assemble | 53 |
| Mesh | 60 |
| Analyze | 104 |
| Manufacture | 66 |
| Drawing | 113 |
| Parameters | 24 |
| Contextual Sketch setup and edit | 117 |

There are 546 unique command IDs after shared actions are deduplicated. These
numbers are a baseline, not a manually maintained source of truth. The live
ribbon manifest must remain authoritative as conditional build features and
preferences change.

Conditional counts are union counts, not a claim that mutually exclusive
dropdown parents are visible simultaneously. For example, the separated
Drawing layout replaces `TechDraw_CompDimensionTools` while adding six IDs, so
that live layout contains 112 actions and the two-layout union contains 113.
The 19 context actions are tracked separately and are not included in the
ribbon totals.

Legacy FreeCAD commands available only from command search or legacy menus are
not part of Native assistant authority. Current SteveCAD context actions that
complete a ribbon workflow are in scope and must be classified separately.

## Provider result contract

### Successful mutation

A normal success contains only:

- `result`: the meaningful created or changed semantic object references and
  operation-specific verification;
- `state`: the smallest domain snapshot needed to continue;
- `next`: included only when a prerequisite or a particularly useful next
  action cannot be inferred from `state`.

The host must not echo the request, normalized arguments, empty arrays, empty
candidate lists, unchanged-state booleans, transaction internals, stack traces,
or duplicated object summaries.

### Successful read

A read returns the requested domain information directly. It does not wrap the
same information in document, observed, normalized, and diagnostic copies.
Pagination or explicit detail levels are required for potentially large data.

### Failure

A normal failure contains only:

- a stable error code;
- one clear human-readable message;
- the exact failing target when one was resolved;
- one repair action when deterministic;
- candidates only when the failure is genuinely ambiguous and the candidates
  are bounded and actionable.

Full native diagnostics, exception information, transaction traces, and timing
data go to the debug record and are referenced by a diagnostic ID only when
needed.

### Host-injected bookkeeping

The assistant should not manually pass revision numbers or retry tokens on
every call. The session adapter freezes the expected document revision and
injects an idempotency token into each mutation. The service verifies both
before mutation. Revision conflicts and duplicate retry results are returned
concisely.

### 12. Implement the Mesh surface

- The first Mesh checkpoint exposes cheap bounded Mesh/Points/Reverse state,
  one shared cancellable background-job control, human-authorized background
  import/export, all six retained regular solids, linked Standard
  shape-to-Mesh tessellation (whole shape or exact faces), linked
  Mesh-to-shape conversion, and exact ray-anchored Curve on Mesh. The tools
  use the same current-History and source-preserving publication machinery as
  the human commands. Their real GUI gates prove stale-state rejection,
  one-step undo/redo, background UI dispatch, source-edit propagation, and
  durable identities, links, settings, History, and geometry across reopen.
- The second Mesh checkpoint exposes the ten human Modify actions as one
  discriminated `mesh.modify` instrument. Every synchronous edit creates its
  retained native Mesh feature, preserves an exact source dependency, and is
  published through the shared replacement-History bridge; multi-source edits
  own independently selectable results under one operation controller and one
  Undo entry. Component removal accepts either the human size rule or stable
  `component-v1` identities derived from exact shared-edge components.
  Smoothing supports all points, explicit indices, or compact non-overlapping
  ranges with a published expansion bound. Gmsh receives no provider-supplied
  executable path: it uses the human Mesh preference, runs detached with
  cancellation and timeout away from the UI thread, and revalidates the full
  source immediately before committing its retained cache. The real GUI gate
  exercises all ten variants, stale-state refusal, exact settings and source
  preservation, multi-output History and undo/redo, durable indexed-edit
  invalidation, background Gmsh, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_MODIFY_GUI_OK variants=10 ...`; the existing Mesh I/O
  and conversion lifecycle gates and the 81-test registry/action suite remain
  green.
- The third Mesh checkpoint exposes all three Boolean and all five Cut ribbon
  actions as two focused instruments: `mesh.boolean` and `mesh.cut`. Boolean
  accepts exactly two closed current-History Mesh solids, preserves source
  order for Difference, creates the retained `MeshPart::Boolean`, and uses an
  additive many-input/one-result History publisher so both replaced inputs
  return together before the operation. Polygon Cut and Trim no longer expose
  the human command's camera-relative gesture as an automation contract: the
  new retained `Mesh::PolygonEdit` stores 3 to 256 ordered coplanar vertices in
  document coordinates and recomputes complete-facet Cut or boundary-clipping
  Trim from those stable parameters. Each may keep one complement or publish
  both under one replacement controller. Datum-plane trim/split reuses
  `Mesh::TrimByPlane`; section and parallel cross-sections reuse the retained
  `MeshPart` wire features and remain source-preserving. Exact datum planes
  are now included in the bounded Mesh snapshot so the provider receives the
  required object name and state digest without a separate exploratory call.
  The real GUI lifecycle proves all eight variants, stale boolean refusal,
  model-space polygon persistence, exact plane context, one-step split
  undo/redo, retained links and History, and valid FCStd recomputation after
  reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_BOOLEAN_CUT_GUI_OK booleans=3 cuts=5
  ...`; Mesh, MeshGui, and SteveCADScripts build cleanly apart from the existing
  GCC/fmt warnings, and the 81-test registry/action suite remains green.
- The fourth Mesh checkpoint exposes every human Segment-group action through
  one discriminated `mesh.segment` instrument: Merge, Split Components,
  curvature Segmentation, Segmentation Best Fit, Reverse Segmentation, Manual
  Segmentation, Segmentation from Components, and Mesh Boundary. Every target
  is an exact current-History mesh with a state digest. Curvature and best-fit
  requests use typed per-surface parameters; manual selection uses bounded
  indices or compact ranges; component results retain stable facet subsets.
  Mesh outputs and recomputable `MeshPart::Boundary` shape outputs are owned by
  the same operation controller when one human action creates both, preserving
  one History entry and one Undo step without losing linked-source semantics.
  Detection operates on private kernel copies, so smoothing used for detection
  cannot mutate the document. The bounded Mesh snapshot now also describes
  linked MeshPart shape topology. The real GUI lifecycle exercises all eight
  actions, stale-state refusal, typed native algorithms, retained boundaries,
  one-step undo/redo, FCStd reopen, and recomputation. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_SEGMENT_GUI_OK actions=8 ...`; all preceding Mesh I/O,
  conversion, Modify, and Boolean/Cut lifecycle gates remain green.
- The fifth Mesh checkpoint exposes all six human Analyze-group actions as two
  deliberately separate instruments. `mesh.inspect` performs bounded facet,
  retained-curvature, solid, and bounding-box reads without touching document
  revision or Undo; its complete defect evaluation operates on a detached Mesh
  in the background, releases the Python lock inside the native evaluators,
  and verifies the exact live source before returning bounded counts and
  samples. `mesh.curvature` is the sole mutation: it creates recomputable,
  source-linked `Mesh::Curvature` results with persisted sample counts and
  source-preserving History ownership in one atomic Undo entry. The real GUI
  lifecycle exercises stale-state rejection, all six ribbon actions, event-loop
  responsiveness, read stability, exact selected facet and vertex data,
  curvature Undo/Redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_ANALYZE_GUI_OK actions=6 ...`.
- The sixth Mesh checkpoint exposes all six human Points-group actions through
  one discriminated `mesh.points` mutation instrument plus the existing
  `mesh.export` instrument. Import and export use human-authorized paths which
  never enter provider arguments or results. Sampling, grid inference, merge,
  polygon selection, and file I/O operate on detached point data in background
  jobs, with native loops releasing the Python lock. Geometry conversion uses
  independently typed `geometry_sources`; merge uses independently typed
  `point_clouds`, preventing schema compaction from weakening either nested
  contract. Every point target includes the published state digest and point
  count. Merge transforms coordinates and normals into document space and
  retains complete aligned intensity, color, and normal arrays; incomplete
  attribute families are omitted explicitly and reported. Structure uses an
  explicit coordinate tolerance and rejects sparse or ambiguous grids.
  Polygon cutting uses 3 to 256 coplanar document-space vertices and never
  depends on the camera. The shared History publisher now additively accepts
  non-Mesh geometry replacement sources while preserving its stricter Mesh
  validation. The real GUI lifecycle exercises all six actions, multi-source
  geometry sampling, exact stale refusal, attributes, structure, model-space
  split, path-redacted round-trip I/O, UI dispatch, one-step Undo/Redo, and
  FCStd reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_POINTS_GUI_OK actions=6 ...`;
  the Boolean/Cut and Segment lifecycle gates remain green.
- The seventh Mesh checkpoint exposes every Reverse Engineering action composed
  into the Mesh ribbon through two focused background instruments:
  `mesh.rebuild` for Poisson reconstruction and structured-cloud triangulation,
  and `mesh.approximate` for plane, cylinder, sphere, polynomial, B-spline
  surface, and B-spline curve fitting. Each operation freezes an exact
  current-History source, performs native geometry work away from the UI
  thread, revalidates immediately before one atomic commit, preserves its
  source, and returns bounded topology plus quantitative fit information.
  Poisson availability follows the compiled PCL Surface feature and reports a
  precise unavailable result when that optional dependency is absent. The real
  GUI lifecycle exercises all eight actions, UI responsiveness, all six fitting
  paths, structured triangulation, conditional Poisson behavior, one-step
  Undo/Redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MESH_REVERSE_GUI_OK actions=8 background=true fits=6
  triangulation=true poisson_conditional=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`;
  the Points, Analyze, Segment, and Boolean/Cut lifecycle gates remain green.
- The completed Mesh surface covers all 60 actions in the live SteveCAD Mesh
  ribbon inventory. Provider context stays cheap: object state carries bounded
  identity, topology counts, bounds, and state digests; explicit inspection
  returns component, manifold, watertight, and bounded defect information only
  when requested; mutations return the exact output topology and settings
  without native arrays or raw geometry dumps. The eight real-GUI suites cover
  I/O, conversion, repair/modify, Boolean/Cut, segmentation, Analyze, Points,
  and Reverse Engineering as interoperable current-History workflows, including
  stale refusal, background dispatch where required, one-step Undo/Redo, and
  FCStd reopen. `MeshPart_CreateFlatMesh` and `MeshPart_CreateFlatFace` remain
  conditional legacy menu-only commands: they are not present in the SteveCAD
  Mesh ribbon action graph and therefore are deliberately not published to the
  ribbon-scoped provider. The fail-closed manifest will require an explicit
  implementation if either command is ever added to the SteveCAD ribbon.

### 13. Implement the Analyze surface

- The first Analyze checkpoint covers all six actions in the live Model group
  with one focused `analyze.model` mutation instrument and three explicit
  `analyze.inspect` reads. Analysis creation can honor the same default-solver
  preference as the human command or deliberately create no solver. Solid,
  fluid, and reinforced materials accept installed catalog UUIDs plus bounded
  typed physical-property overrides; overrides explicitly clear catalog
  identity instead of retaining a false card UUID. References use exact
  current-History object state and explicit `SolidN`, `FaceN`, or `EdgeN`
  names, never ambient selection. The Material Editor ribbon action becomes an
  exact in-place edit of one durable FEM material and never opens modal UI.
  Analysis/material reads and bounded catalog search do not advance structural
  revision or Undo. Nonlinear behavior uses native resource reconciliation:
  the nonlinear object is a canonical resource immediately before its solid
  material root, preserving the native `solid.Nonlinear` dependency without a
  later-root DAG violation or a fabricated extra operation. The dispatcher
  lifecycle gate exercises the actual Analyze ribbon mapping, all six
  mutations, all three reads, default-solver preference, solid/fluid/reinforced
  cards, typed overrides, nonlinear hardening data, stale refusal, canonical
  History, one-step Undo/Redo, and exact links, proxies, maps, UUIDs, and roles
  after FCStd reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MODEL_GUI_OK actions=6
  reads=3 exact_targets=true catalog=true history=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The second Analyze checkpoint covers all four live Geometry-group actions
  with one strongly typed `analyze.geometry` instrument plus one exact
  `analyze.inspect` read. Beam sections expose five discriminated shapes;
  shell thickness accepts only positive physical thickness; beam rotations
  use explicit degrees; and 1D liquid sections expose every CalculiX section
  type currently offered by the human editor with only its applicable fields.
  Edge-based definitions accept only exact current `EdgeN` references, shell
  definitions accept only exact current `FaceN` references, and an empty list
  deliberately means a global assignment. Every definition is a real analysis
  member and durable root History operation. Exact in-place edit variants let
  the assistant correct labels, assignments, or engineering values without
  appending replacement clutter; they reject stale targets, wrong subelement
  kinds, nonphysical pipe/box dimensions, invalid area transitions, and
  malformed pump curves before mutation. Provider context now includes
  bounded normalized element-definition state and opaque state hashes, while
  create responses return only the next exact analysis target plus the created
  definition rather than repeating the full analysis membership. The real GUI
  lifecycle exercises the actual ribbon mappings, all four create and edit
  paths, every beam/fluid discriminator, exact edge/face references, rejected
  invalid input, read-only revision stability, canonical History, one-step
  Undo/Redo, and exact values, proxies, links, and roles after FCStd reopen. It
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_GEOMETRY_GUI_OK actions=4 edits=4 reads=1
  exact_references=true typed_sections=true history=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The third Analyze checkpoint covers all four live Electromagnetics child
  actions with one discriminated `analyze.electromagnetic` instrument and one
  exact `analyze.inspect` read. The composite ribbon button remains a
  human-only parent and exposes no duplicate provider operation. Dirichlet and
  Neumann boundaries publish only fields active for their mode; current
  density separates enabled Cartesian components from a normal boundary
  value; magnetization carries one or more explicitly enabled complex axes;
  and electric charge distinguishes interface, source, total-interface, and
  distributed or concentrated total-source modes. All quantities use named SI
  units. References are exact current-History targets, including vertices for
  concentrated charge, and mode-incompatible topology is rejected before a
  transaction. Solver-supported global current-density and magnetization
  assignments remain available, while ambiguous multiple-global states are
  refused. Creates are real analysis members and durable History roots;
  in-place edits do not append replacement features; reads do not advance
  structural revision. The lifecycle gate exercises the live ribbon mapping,
  all four creates and edits, every discriminator, mixed references, invalid
  topology, global-assignment safety, Elmer Cartesian serialization, stale
  refusal, canonical History, one-step Undo/Redo, and exact proxies, units,
  values, references, and hashes after FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_ELECTROMAGNETIC_GUI_OK actions=4 edits=4 reads=1
  exact_references=true typed_modes=true history=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The fourth Analyze checkpoint covers the three live Fluid-group actions with
  one `analyze.fluid` instrument and one exact `analyze.inspect` read. Initial
  velocity and boundary velocity use a small per-axis discriminator: each
  specified axis is either an SI value in metres per second or one bounded,
  single-line Elmer expression; omitted axes remain genuinely unspecified.
  Initial pressure is an explicit signed value in pascals. Solver-supported
  global initial conditions use an intentional empty reference list and are
  rejected whenever another constraint of the same type would make that
  global meaning ambiguous. Boundary velocity always requires exact current
  geometry, including mixed supported subelement kinds. Creates are real
  analysis members and durable History roots, exact edits update in place,
  formula/control characters and stale geometry are rejected before mutation,
  and reads do not advance structural revision. The real GUI lifecycle covers
  all three creates and edits, numeric and formula axes, global ambiguity,
  mixed references, invalid multiline formula refusal, native solver-facing
  fields, canonical History, Undo/Redo, and exact proxies, values, formulas,
  assignments, and hashes after FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_FLUID_GUI_OK actions=3 edits=3 reads=1
  exact_references=true typed_velocity=true history=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The fifth Analyze checkpoint covers all three live Geometrical Analysis
  Features with a separate `analyze.geometrical` instrument and one exact
  `analyze.inspect` read. Plane rotation accepts exactly one current planar
  face. Section print accepts exactly one current face and exposes the four
  solver-backed result variables as a closed enum. Local coordinate systems
  use a discriminated rectangular or cylindrical definition: rectangular
  mode takes one explicit axis-angle rotation, while cylindrical mode derives
  its origin and axis from one cylindrical support face. A transform support
  must already be referenced by a displacement condition or force load in the
  same analysis; rejection reports the bounded set of eligible faces instead
  of merely saying that the target type is wrong. Creates are real analysis
  members and durable History roots, exact edits update the same operation,
  stale targets and invalid surface geometry are refused before mutation, and
  reads do not advance structural revision. The checkpoint also corrected the
  shared native FEM subshape resolver to request the named subelement rather
  than silently returning its owning solid, made cylinder-frame extraction
  reject invalid or degenerate surfaces without throwing, and refreshes the
  derived frame when transform type changes. Those native fixes apply equally
  to the human editor and Native tools. The real GUI lifecycle covers all
  three creates and edits, transform eligibility, rectangular and cylindrical
  frames, native fields, canonical History, Undo/Redo, and exact values,
  references, identities, and hashes after FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_GEOMETRICAL_GUI_OK actions=3 edits=3 reads=1
  exact_faces=true typed_frames=true eligibility=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The sixth Analyze checkpoint covers the four mechanical support actions with
  one focused `analyze.support` instrument and one exact `analyze.inspect`
  read. Fixed, rigid-body, displacement, and spring conditions each require
  exact current geometry and preserve the human tool's allowed subelement
  kinds. Rigid-body degrees of freedom are explicit per-axis discriminators:
  translation axes are free, prescribed displacement, or applied force;
  rotation axes are free, prescribed rotation, or applied moment. The tool
  converts prescribed rotation components to the solver's native axis-angle
  property without exposing its storage mechanics. Displacement axes are
  free, numeric, or a bounded single-line formula, rotational axes are free or
  numeric, and flow-surface-force mode is admitted only when every axis is
  free. Surface springs expose both physical stiffnesses plus the exact Elmer
  component and reject a non-positive selected stiffness. Every create is a
  real analysis member and durable History root; exact edits update the same
  object, stale targets and mixed reference kinds fail before mutation, and
  inspection does not advance structural revision. The real GUI lifecycle
  covers all four creates and edits, invalid mixed references and flow state,
  numeric/formula/load modes, solver-native fields, canonical History,
  Undo/Redo, and exact definitions, references, identities, and hashes after
  FCStd reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_SUPPORT_GUI_OK actions=4
  edits=4 reads=1 exact_references=true typed_dofs=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The seventh Analyze checkpoint covers Contact and Tie with one focused
  `analyze.connection` instrument and one exact `analyze.inspect` read. Both
  operations name their slave and master endpoints explicitly, eliminating
  the solver-significant but previously opaque ordering of a generic
  references list. Each endpoint is exactly one current face, or one current
  edge for a 2D model; both endpoints must have the same dimensional kind and
  cannot name the same subelement. Contact exposes positive solver-backed
  contact stiffness, non-negative clearance adjustment, and a closed
  frictionless/Coulomb discriminator whose Coulomb branch requires positive
  coefficient and stick stiffness. Tie exposes the human editor's tolerance
  and node-adjustment controls. Solver properties not offered by the human
  editors, including thermal contact and cyclic symmetry, are not invented as
  AI-only inputs, but remain part of exact state hashing so external changes
  cannot be silently overwritten. Creates are real analysis members and
  durable History roots, exact edits preserve object identity and endpoint
  roles, stale targets fail before mutation, and reads keep structural
  revision stable. The real GUI lifecycle covers both creates and edits,
  mixed-dimension and duplicate-endpoint refusal, face and 2D-edge pairs,
  frictionless and Coulomb contact, native properties, canonical History,
  Undo/Redo, and exact definitions, endpoints, identities, and hashes after
  FCStd reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_CONNECTION_GUI_OK actions=2
  edits=2 reads=1 exact_roles=true typed_contact=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The eighth Analyze checkpoint covers all four Mechanics load actions with
  one focused `analyze.load` instrument and one exact `analyze.inspect` read.
  Each operation has a direct, tailored schema rather than a generic load
  object. Force requires positive newtons, exact current loaded geometry of
  one common vertex/edge/face kind, and either the geometry's natural normal
  or one exact linear-edge, planar-face, or datum direction with explicit
  reversal. Pressure requires positive pascals and exact face or 2D-edge
  geometry. Centrifugal load requires positive frequency, exactly one current
  linear edge as its axis, and a closed all-bodies or selected-geometry scope.
  Gravity requires positive acceleration and a nonzero direction that is
  normalized and canonically rounded before native assignment; only one
  global gravity load may exist in an analysis. Force and pressure amplitude
  data remains part of exact hashing without adding controls absent from the
  human editors. Creates are real analysis members and durable History roots,
  edits preserve identity, source hashes guard load/direction/axis geometry,
  stale calls fail before mutation, failed postconditions name their exact
  invariant, and reads do not advance structural revision. The real GUI
  lifecycle covers all four creates and edits, invalid curved force direction,
  natural and referenced directions, face and 2D-edge loads, all/selected
  centrifugal scopes, gravity uniqueness and normalization, solver-native
  values, canonical History, Undo/Redo, and exact values, references,
  identities, and hashes after FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_LOAD_GUI_OK actions=4 edits=4 reads=1
  exact_directions=true typed_scopes=true global_gravity=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`.
- The ninth Analyze checkpoint covers all four Thermal ribbon actions through
  one focused `analyze.thermal` instrument and one exact `analyze.inspect`
  read. The contract exposes the human editors' solver-significant modes as
  explicit operations: analysis-global initial temperature; distributed
  surface flux, convection, and radiation; prescribed geometry temperature
  and concentrated nodal heat input; and body heat generation by mass rate or
  total power. Each operation accepts only its active SI fields, so inactive
  values from the shared native object types never become ambiguous provider
  inputs. Surface conditions require exact current faces or 2D edges, nodal
  conditions accept vertices, edges, or faces, body sources accept solids or
  shell faces, and one analysis may contain only one global initial
  temperature. Temperatures are non-negative Kelvin, transfer coefficients
  are positive, emissivity is in `(0, 1]`, and heat inputs are explicitly
  nonzero while retaining their physical sign. Amplitude, cavity-radiation,
  and final-temperature fields absent from the human editors' active tasks are
  not invented as AI-only controls, but remain in exact hashes so external
  edits cannot be silently overwritten. Creates are real analysis members and
  durable History roots, mode-preserving edits retain identity, stale calls
  fail before mutation, and reads do not advance structural revision. The
  real GUI lifecycle covers all eight modes and edits, invalid mixed geometry,
  global-initial uniqueness, native solver values, canonical History,
  Undo/Redo, and exact values, references, identities, and hashes after FCStd
  reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_THERMAL_GUI_OK actions=4 modes=8
  edits=8 reads=1 exact_references=true typed_conditions=true
  global_initial=true history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true
  read_revision_stable=true`.
- The tenth Analyze checkpoint establishes durable Gmsh and Netgen mesh
  definitions without falsely treating expensive generation as an immediate
  document mutation. `analyze.mesh` creates or edits exactly one mesher owned
  by an analysis, requires one exact current shape, exposes only the settings
  present in the corresponding human task panel, and clears generated mesh
  data only when source or meshing settings change. Both definitions retain
  canonical History identity, undo/redo, and save/reopen state. The real GUI
  lifecycle emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_GUI_OK actions=2 meshers=2
  edits=2 exact_sources=true one_mesh_per_analysis=true definitions_only=true
  history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`. Actual
  backend execution remains deliberately open in 13.36 and 13.37 so it can be
  implemented with a frozen background plan and a main-thread commit.
- The eleventh Analyze checkpoint covers the five primary mesh-refinement
  resources and all three structured transfinite resources. Region, group,
  distance, boundary-layer, and analytic-shape fields accept only their
  solver-valid geometry kinds and settings. Transfinite curve, surface, and
  volume definitions have their own compact tool with explicit node,
  distribution, orientation, automation, recombination, inversion, and mixed-
  element controls. Each resource is a canonical child in its mesh History
  block rather than an extra root operation; semantic edits invalidate stale
  generated mesh data and label-only edits do not. The two real GUI lifecycle
  gates emit `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_REFINEMENT_GUI_OK actions=5 modes=5
  edits=5 exact_geometry=true owned_resources=true invalidation=true
  history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true read_revision_stable=true` and
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_STRUCTURED_MESH_GUI_OK actions=3 modes=3 edits=3
  typed_distribution=true mixed_surface_geometry=true owned_resources=true
  history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The twelfth Analyze checkpoint covers Gmsh field composition with one
  `analyze.mesh_field` instrument containing twenty operation-specific
  branches and no unknown schema types. It implements restrict, threshold,
  mean, gradient, curvature, Laplacian, anisotropic-curve, scalar-math,
  anisotropic-math, and distance fields. Inputs are exact revision targets,
  must be active field-producing resources owned by the same mesh, are bounded
  to Gmsh's eight math inputs, and are traversed transitively so cycles and
  stale descendants fail before mutation. Geometry is limited to the kinds
  each generated Gmsh field actually consumes, equations reject unavailable
  `F#` inputs, all resources live inside the owning mesh History block, and
  semantic edits invalidate generated data. The 20-variant schema is 9,876
  bytes with no `unknown` token. The real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_FIELD_GUI_OK actions=2 kinds=10 edits=10
  exact_dependencies=true cycle_rejection=true typed_geometry=true
  owned_resources=true history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`. Result-backed
  advanced fields remain open until the FEM result family can supply an exact
  field-data target; object name alone is intentionally not accepted as proof.
- The thirteenth Analyze checkpoint implements cancellable background Gmsh
  and Netgen generation without allowing a worker thread to touch the live
  document. The main thread freezes the exact mesher, source, owned refinement
  graph, History order, configured backend, and generated input files; the
  worker owns only the subprocess and bounded artifact bytes; and the main
  thread imports the artifact through one reauthorized mutation transaction.
  Changes made while a backend runs reject the stale artifact, one document
  admits only one active Native background job, cancellation ends before
  commit, and `native.job` returns concise progress and terminal results. This
  checkpoint also adds an explicit detached mode to the stock FEM preparation
  helpers so preflight does not write `Tool` or `WorkingDirectory`, and fixes
  `PropertyFemMesh` transaction snapshots to deep-copy mutable mesh data so a
  generated mesh is genuinely undoable. Existing interactive FEM helper
  behavior remains the default. The real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_GENERATION_GUI_OK backends=2 background=true
  responsive=true cancellation=true exact_commit=true refinements=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The fourteenth Analyze checkpoint covers the two mesh-output actions without
  exposing ambient selection or dumping an entire FEM mesh into context.
  `analyze.inspect.fem_mesh_elements` returns bounded 64-element pages with
  exact IDs, connectivity, centroids, and bounds. `analyze.mesh_output` erases
  either at most 256 explicit IDs or up to one million IDs expressed as 256
  sorted inclusive ranges, rejects gaps and non-primary IDs, and always leaves
  at least one primary element. The filtered `Fem::FemMeshObject` is a durable
  resource owned by the human-compatible `FemSetElementNodes` History
  operation. The conversion variant creates an ordinary `Mesh::Feature` from
  the undeformed exterior and uses a new additive converter whose face keys do
  not impose the legacy one-million-node-ID packing limit. Both operations
  preserve exact input content, replacement presentation, canonical History,
  and undo/redo. Generic baked and filtered FEM meshes now have bounded exact
  state in Analyze context, so later turns can target them directly. The real
  GUI lifecycle emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_OUTPUT_GUI_OK actions=2
  variants=3 inspect=true exact_ids=true ranges=true atomic_rejection=true
  filtered_resource=true conversion_facets=6 history=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true read_revision_stable=true`. Result-deformed conversion remains
  open until the result slice supplies an exact displacement-field target.
- The fifteenth Analyze checkpoint covers all four solver-definition actions
  with one focused `analyze.solver` tool. Each operation accepts only an exact
  analysis revision and a visible label, then delegates to the same
  `createDefaultSolverFeature` factory used by the human Analyze workflow so
  CalculiX pipeline selection and every backend preference remain authoritative
  in one place. Solver creation is deliberately separate from job control and
  execution. Analyze context and `analyze.inspect.solver` expose bounded exact
  backend kind, implementation, owning analysis, suppression state, settings,
  children, History role, and state hash without advancing structural revision.
  The real GUI lifecycle changes backend preferences before creating CalculiX,
  Elmer, Mystran, and Z88 solvers; proves exact analysis membership, stale-target
  rejection, canonical History, undo/redo, and FCStd reopen; and emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_SOLVER_GUI_OK actions=4 variants=4
  human_factories=true preferences=true exact_analysis=true
  stale_rejection=true inspect=true read_revision_stable=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true`. The gate also corrected the human Analyze toolbar
  to include its existing Erase Elements command, matching the already-shipped
  command and Native action inventory rather than weakening fail-closed surface
  validation.
- The sixteenth Analyze checkpoint covers all ten equation actions with one
  `analyze.equation` tool whose variants share only `solver` and `label`.
  Creation requires an exact Elmer solver root, calls the same stock
  `ObjectsFem.makeEquation*` factories as the human actions, preserves their
  backend defaults and descending priorities, and publishes each equation as
  an owned resource in the solver's canonical History block. A bounded FEM
  property serializer retains meaningful scalar, enumeration, quantity, and
  list settings while excluding object links and unsupported opaque values;
  rejection diagnostics identify the exact property name and native type.
  Analyze context and `analyze.inspect.equation` expose exact kind, solver,
  priority, settings, History ownership, and state hash without changing
  structural revision. The real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_EQUATION_GUI_OK actions=10 variants=10
  exact_elmer=true defaults=true priorities=true owned_resources=true
  stale_rejection=true inspect=true read_revision_stable=true history=true
  undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The seventeenth Analyze checkpoint separates persistent solver settings from
  process execution. The focused `analyze.solver_control` tool has three
  backend-specific operations and exposes all 54 writable document controls
  actually observed by the CalculiX, Elmer, and Z88 task panels. Every field
  is bounded and typed; model-facing units and integration orders are converted
  to the native property representation only at the mutation boundary. The
  preflight rejects wrong backends, stale solver hashes, exact no-ops, invalid
  eigenmode/time/iteration relationships, unknown settings, and unsupported
  values before opening a transaction. The mutation changes only explicitly
  supplied properties, preserves the exact analysis membership and canonical
  History graph, and returns the complete new solver state plus only the
  requested semantic settings. Mystran deliberately has no settings variant:
  its sole AnalysisType is locked to static and its useful controls belong to
  the execution/input-artifact slice. The real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_SOLVER_CONTROL_GUI_OK actions=1 variants=3
  typed_settings=54 exact_backend=true cross_field_validation=true
  wrong_backend_rejection=true no_op_rejection=true stale_rejection=true
  history_stable=true inspect=true read_revision_stable=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true`.
- The eighteenth Analyze checkpoint exposes one focused
  `analyze.solver_execution` `run` operation for every shipped solver kind and
  both CalculiX implementations. The main-thread boundary freezes the exact
  solver, History, retention preference, input artifacts, executable sequence,
  environment, timeout, and input digest before a shell-free worker runs the
  configured external processes. Every run uses an isolated temporary
  directory, a 4 GiB/4,096-file input ceiling, a 16 MiB diagnostic ceiling,
  cooperative process-tree cancellation, bounded status/error results, and
  cleanup on success, refusal, cancellation, stale commit, and import failure.
  CalculiX pipeline, CalculiX standard, Elmer, Mystran, and Z88 now have
  detached preparation/import adapters; missing backend executables or
  optional Mystran writer/reader modules fail with exact dependency guidance
  before a job is launched.
  Solver results no longer form independent later History operations or carry
  a reverse producer link. The solver is the single semantic operation and
  generated result roots/outputs are canonical nested resources immediately
  before it, so the real document graph remains a DAG. The shared reconciler
  preserves equations and unrelated solver resources, validates every exact
  identity, supports stable-root updates, safely replaces Mystran-style result
  graphs only when downstream consumers can be mapped exactly, and otherwise
  refuses instead of leaving stale or dangling objects. The real GUI lifecycle
  runs both CalculiX implementations through actual input writers and fake
  external executables, proves event-loop progress, typed job polling, nested
  result ownership, exact graph replacement, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd
  reopen. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_SOLVER_EXECUTION_GUI_OK action=1
  implementations=2 background=true ui_responsive=true exact_input=true
  job_status=true exact_commit=true history=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
  The focused execution, background, adoption, manifest, context, registry,
  and capability suite is 99/99 green; touched production and gate Python
  passes Ruff, the FEM/SteveCAD script targets rebuild, and `git diff --check`
  is clean. Row 18.24 remains open for a deliberately large solver-input and
  cancellation acceptance case rather than treating the representative
  cantilever lifecycle as a stress test.
- The nineteenth Analyze checkpoint establishes one exact, bounded result-data
  boundary and one shared result-graph purge engine. `analyze.inspect.result`
  reads legacy mechanical results and VTK post objects by opaque state hash,
  returning only identity, ownership, point/cell counts, field metadata, and
  scalar or vector-magnitude ranges; native result arrays never enter provider
  context. Rolling Analyze context is smaller still: it carries at most 16
  result references and 16 bounded field names per result. Read calls leave
  structural revision and History unchanged and survive FCStd reopen.
  `analyze.results.purge` requires the exact analysis revision, graph digest,
  and object count. The shared FEM planner distinguishes direct solver result
  roots, nested generated outputs, independent post operations/resources, and
  untracked legacy artifacts; rejects downstream consumers outside the purge
  graph; and rewrites solver History while retaining the solver, equations,
  model, and meshes. The human `FEM_ResultsPurge` ribbon action now uses that
  same FEM-owned engine instead of a separate selection-driven generic delete.
  The real dispatcher lifecycle proves nested `solver.Results`, post-pipeline
  dependencies, concurrent-result stale refusal, exact receipts, one
  transaction, one-step Undo/Redo, canonical History, retained inputs, and
  FCStd reopen. The two gates emit
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_RESULT_INSPECT_GUI_OK variants=1 exact_targets=true
  legacy_ranges=true vtk_ranges=true ownership=true bounded_context=true
  read_revision_stable=true reopen=true` and
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_RESULT_PURGE_GUI_OK action=1 exact_graph=true
  nested_solver_results=true post_processing=true stale_rejection=true
  retained_inputs=true history=true one_transaction=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true`. The focused manifest, registry, and capability inventory is
  75/75 green, the existing human purge GUI test passes through the shared
  engine, touched Python passes Ruff, both script targets rebuild, and
  `git diff --check` is clean.
- The twentieth Analyze checkpoint implements `FEM_ResultShow` as one sharp
  `analyze.presentation` `show_result` operation. One exact legacy mechanical
  result target selects its semantic scalar field, deformation scale, and
  visibility atomically; the response contains the displayed range,
  available semantic fields, and the next exact result target, but never node
  identities, displacement vectors, scalar arrays, or renderer color data.
  Unsupported result fields return the exact currently available fields and
  deformation bounds. Presentation is applied directly through the FEM mesh
  view provider without opening the task panel, a document transaction, or an
  Undo entry, while the human result dialog receives compatible current state.
  Manual entry into that dialog clears Native semantic presentation metadata
  so later inspection cannot claim a stale field selected by the assistant.
  Timeline end visibility is now correctly classified as presentation state,
  transient group-touch notifications no longer advance Native structural
  revision, and timeline visibility capture no longer emits an unchanged
  suppression property. The real dispatcher gate proves field availability
  repair, scalar-field switching, displacement application/reset, visibility,
  exact-target chaining, stale refusal without side effects, bounded output,
  stable History/revision/Undo, and an honest unmanaged state after FCStd
  reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_RESULT_PRESENTATION_GUI_OK action=1 fields=true
  field_repair=true exact_target=true no_arrays=true stale_rejection=true
  no_transaction=true revision_stable=true reset=true reopen=true`. The
  focused state, manifest, registry, and capability suite is 97/97 green; the
  App, FEM-script, and SteveCAD-script targets rebuild, and touched Python
  passes Ruff.
- The twenty-first Analyze checkpoint folds both shipped FEM clipping commands
  into the same focused `analyze.presentation` capability. The provider adds a
  plane only from an exact live `FaceN` plus shape-and-global-placement digest,
  and removes planes only from an exact active-view clipping graph digest and
  count. It supports explicit normal reversal, caps and summarizes the Coin
  scene graph without exposing scene nodes, rolls the next exact clipping
  target forward, rejects stale graph or face state before changing the view,
  restores presentation on guarded failure, and reports an empty removal as a
  no-op. The human ribbon actions and Native calls now share the small FEM
  clipping engine; its bounded-box calculation also removes the legacy debug
  console spam. Analyze context contains the concise clipping graph and an
  exact face-target token beside each bounded geometry source. The real GUI
  gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_CLIPPING_GUI_OK actions=2 exact_face=true
  exact_graph=true reverse=true stale_rejection=true no_op=true
  no_transaction=true revision_stable=true camera_stable=true reopen=true`.
  The existing human flat/empty-document clipping GUI test also passes, the
  result-presentation lifecycle remains green, and the focused state,
  manifest, context, registry, and capability suite is 108/108 green.
- The twenty-second Analyze checkpoint implements
  `FEM_PostPipelineFromResult` as the first exact `analyze.post` operation.
  One exact legacy result and one exact owning analysis create and load a real
  `Fem::FemPostPipeline` without task-panel automation. The source result is
  retained, the pipeline is enrolled as the final History root, visible-source
  replacement metadata is exact, and the concise response reports native VTK
  point/cell counts and field summaries without returning result arrays. The
  real GUI gate proves canonical field loading, exact ownership, bounded
  output, one transaction, visibility restoration through undo, redo identity,
  and FCStd reopen persistence. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK action=1 exact_result=true
  exact_analysis=true data=true no_arrays=true history=true
  one_transaction=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The twenty-third Analyze checkpoint adds `FEM_PostBranchFilter` to the same
  concise `analyze.post` capability. An exact pipeline, branch, or ordinary
  filter target deterministically resolves its direct destination group and
  one owning pipeline; ambiguous, detached, or cyclic graphs fail before a
  transaction with repair context. The provider explicitly chooses serial or
  parallel child input and passthrough or appended output, while the mutation
  creates one real `Fem::FemPostBranchFilter`, copies the source result color,
  preserves the source object, records replacement only when the source was
  visible, and returns the next exact graph targets without VTK arrays. The
  extended real GUI gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=2 exact_result=true
  exact_analysis=true exact_post_source=true data=true no_arrays=true
  history=true one_transaction_each=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The twenty-fourth Analyze checkpoint adds `FEM_PostFilterWarp` as an exact
  `create_warp` variant. It accepts only a named three-component point field
  that exists on the exact source and a bounded finite factor, returns the
  available vector fields when repair is needed, joins the deterministic post
  group, and uses FreeCAD's real dynamic field enumeration rather than task-
  panel emulation. The filter is published before the in-transaction discovery
  recompute, then configured and verified as one History/Undo operation. The
  real GUI gate confirms the selected displacement field, native millimetre/
  metre factor conversion through actual warped coordinates, source retention,
  exact replacement, undo/redo identity, bounded output, and reopen persistence;
  it emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=3
  exact_result=true exact_analysis=true exact_post_source=true data=true
  vector_field=true warp_geometry=true no_arrays=true history=true
  one_transaction_each=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The twenty-fifth Analyze checkpoint adds `FEM_PostFilterClipScalar` as a
  typed `create_scalar_clip` operation in the separate post-filter module. It
  accepts only a scalar point field that exists on the exact source and a
  finite threshold inside that field's current native range; unavailable
  fields and out-of-range values return bounded field/range repair data before
  mutation. Known VTK result fields now carry canonical units in inspection
  and repair summaries, making the verified 10–80 MPa test data explicit as
  10–80 million Pa. The real GUI gate proves the selected field, SI threshold,
  actual clipped VTK range, deterministic serial placement after the warp,
  source retention/replacement, one transaction, complete multi-step undo/
  redo, bounded no-array output, and reopen persistence. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=4 ...
  scalar_field=true range=true no_arrays=true history=true
  one_transaction_each=true undo_redo=true reopen=true`.
- The twenty-sixth Analyze checkpoint adds a separate sharp
  `analyze.post_function` capability for the shipped plane, sphere, cylinder,
  and box actions (including the parent dropdown's default plane action).
  Every operation requires an exact pipeline plus fully typed millimetre
  geometry; nonzero directions are normalized and all sizes are positive and
  bounded. The first function atomically adds one shared function provider as
  a History resource owned by the pipeline, and later functions reuse that
  provider while remaining independent root operations. Pipeline digests now
  include the bounded nested post graph, and result summaries identify exact
  owning pipelines, so adding a provider child always rolls exact targets
  forward. The eight-action real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=8 ...
  post_functions=4 normalized_directions=true provider_resource=true
  no_arrays=true history=true one_transaction_each=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true` and proves one-transaction provider creation, stable identities,
  complete reverse/forward undo order, and FCStd ownership persistence.
- The twenty-seventh Analyze checkpoint connects those reusable functions to
  `FEM_PostFilterCutFunction` and `FEM_PostFilterClipRegion`. Both typed
  `analyze.post` variants require exact source and function hashes, resolve one
  deterministic source pipeline, and reject functions owned by any other
  pipeline before mutation. Region clipping additionally requires explicit
  inside/out and whole-cell-versus-interpolated behavior. Each real filter
  retains both dependencies, publishes one replacement History root, and
  returns exact next targets without result arrays. The ten-action GUI gate
  proves nonempty native cut and clipped datasets, exact same-pipeline links,
  serial placement, source visibility replacement, full ten-step undo/redo,
  stable identity, and reopen persistence; it emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=10 ...
  implicit_cut=true region_clip=true same_pipeline_functions=true ...`.
- The twenty-eighth Analyze checkpoint adds `FEM_PostFilterContours` as a
  fully typed contour operation. It validates an exact varying point field,
  enforces scalar versus vector-component choices, bounds the requested
  visible contour count to FreeCAD's native 1–1000 contract, and makes field
  coloring, smoothing, and relaxation explicit. After exact History
  publication, one discovery recompute obtains the native dynamic field and
  component enumerations; the final mutation configures both VTK output and
  view-provider coloring in the same transaction. The eleven-action GUI gate
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=11 ...
  contours=true contour_presentation=true ...` and proves a nonempty contour
  dataset, deterministic serial placement, replacement visibility, complete
  undo/redo identity, bounded output, and reopen persistence.
- The twenty-ninth Analyze checkpoint implements the two source-preserving
  probe operations and the read-only stress-linearization action. Exact line
  probes require an available point field, a component valid for that field,
  a nonzero millimetre line, and a bounded 1–100000 interval count. Exact point
  probes require one available field and one finite millimetre point; scalar
  fields return the scalar and multicomponent fields return the magnitude.
  Both create durable native post-filter History roots, preserve the source's
  current visibility, and return only validity counts, ranges, endpoint
  samples, or one point value—never `XAxisData`, `YAxisData`, `PointData`, or
  VTK arrays. Two narrow typed FEM Python bridges configure the otherwise
  read-only native field selectors without weakening those properties. The
  native filters now refresh sampled outputs after every recompute, and the
  point filter creates one VTK point instead of the upstream default of ten
  coincident points. Stress linearization is correctly classified as a read,
  leaves structural revision and Undo unchanged, and exactly integrates the
  piecewise-linear stress field to report membrane, bending, total, and peak
  residual summaries in the field's canonical SI unit. The fourteen-action
  lifecycle emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=14 ...
  source_preserving_samples=true stress_linearization=true
  compact_sample_results=true ...` and proves real sampled values, exact
  graph ownership, History, full undo/redo identity, bounded output, and FCStd
  reopen persistence.
- The thirtieth Analyze checkpoint implements `FEM_PostFilterCalculator` as a
  typed `create_calculated_field` operation. The provider supplies bounded
  reverse-Polish tokens for numbers, exact point fields/components,
  coordinates, basis vectors, and a closed operator set; the runtime validates
  stack arity and scalar/vector types before compiling the expression to the
  native VTK calculator. Arbitrary native expressions are never accepted or
  returned. Result names are collision-checked, invalid-value behavior is
  explicit, and one engineering unit is validated and persisted on the real
  native calculator object. Line samples now persist their selected field unit
  as well, so calculated fields retain truthful units through downstream
  probes, dimensional stress-linearization checks, undo/redo, and FCStd
  reopen. The fifteen-action real GUI lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=15 ...
  typed_calculator=true durable_units=true stress_linearization=true ...` and
  proves real 10–80 MPa VTK output, downstream 10–15 MPa sampling, exact graph
  ownership, bounded no-array responses, one transaction, stable redo
  identity, and reopen persistence. The affected native FEM target compiles
  cleanly and the focused manifest, registry, context, and schema suite is
  75/75 green.
- The thirty-first Analyze checkpoint implements `FEM_PostFilterGlyph` as an
  exact `create_glyphs` operation over the compiled Python/VTK glyph filter.
  Glyph shape, optional three-component orientation field, scalar or vector
  scaling semantics, positive scale factor, and all/every-Nth/uniform sampling
  are separate typed choices rather than task-panel state. Preflight resolves
  fields against the exact source and caps every request at 25,000 glyph
  locations; an oversized request fails before mutation with an immediately
  usable uniform-sampling repair. The shared human filter now also reapplies
  VTK scaling when `VectorScaleMode` changes, fixing a missing native property
  callback instead of compensating in the AI layer. The sixteen-action real
  GUI lifecycle emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=16
  ... glyphs=true bounded_glyphs=true ...` and proves real oriented/scaled
  arrow output, exact serial graph placement, source replacement, bounded
  no-array output, one transaction, undo/redo identity, Python-proxy restore,
  and FCStd reopen persistence. The focused surface suite remains 75/75 green.
- The thirty-second Analyze checkpoint implements the three compiled
  visualization children—`FEM_PostVisualizationTable`,
  `FEM_PostVisualizationHistogram`, and
  `FEM_PostVisualizationLineplot`—through one concise
  `analyze.visualization` family with three exact operation branches. Each
  mutation atomically creates the real FEM visualization root and its typed
  field-data or point-over-frames extractor, publishes the extractor as the
  root's durable History resource, and retains exact analysis, pipeline, and
  source ownership. Field, position, point-index, component, frame, and plot
  settings are strongly typed; table extraction is capped at 500,000 scalar
  cells, histogram bins are bounded by both 10,000 and the extracted row
  count, logarithmic axes reject nonpositive data, and responses contain only
  column names, finite ranges, and endpoint values rather than native arrays.
  The nineteen-action compiled GUI lifecycle opens and renders the actual
  table, histogram, and line-plot widgets, then proves one-transaction
  creation, exact History ordering, resource ownership, full undo/redo object
  identity, and FCStd reopen persistence. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_POST_PIPELINE_GUI_OK actions=19 ... table=true
  histogram=true line_plot=true rendered_visualizations=true ...`. The
  broader registry, manifest, context, session, and dispatch suite is 97/97
  green.
- The thirty-third Analyze checkpoint completes the human Advanced Mesh
  panel's Result-backed Gmsh `PostView` field as explicit `create_result` and
  `update_result` variants of `analyze.mesh_field`. The provider supplies one
  exact post-pipeline/filter target plus one named scalar point field; Native
  validates every value as finite and strictly positive, retains the live
  result object and field on the real `Fem::MeshAdvanced` resource, includes
  the result object's durable identity and state in the refinement hash, and
  invalidates generated mesh data after a semantic edit. Normal responses
  expose only the source name, field, value count, finite range, and unit—not
  native arrays. The compiled eleven-kind lifecycle rejects a zero-valued
  field before mutation, changes both source and field, and proves exact
  History ownership, transaction rollback, undo/redo identity, and FCStd
  reopen persistence. It emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_FIELD_GUI_OK ...
  result_source_identity=true positive_scalar_field=true
  nonpositive_field_rejection=true ...`; the focused registry, action, context,
  and capability suite remains 75/75 green.
- The thirty-fourth Analyze checkpoint completes the human FEM Mesh-to-Mesh
  action's result-deformed branch as a separate
  `convert_deformed_surface` variant rather than an ambiguous optional mode.
  It requires one exact active FEM mesh and one exact legacy mechanical result
  linked to that same mesh, resolves deterministic exterior-node identities,
  rejects inconsistent, incomplete, duplicate, or non-finite displacement
  data before mutation, and fingerprints the relevant displacement values.
  The conversion bakes the scale-1 deformed exterior into a standard
  `Mesh::Feature`, verifies its full geometry fingerprint and exact facet
  count, and stores read-only FEM mesh/result provenance plus conversion mode
  on the durable result. Responses contain only mode, exterior/facet counts,
  source identities, surface-node count, and displacement-magnitude range.
  The compiled four-variant lifecycle rejects a mismatched result atomically,
  confirms deformed bounds, and proves History replacement, undo/redo
  identity, and FCStd reopen provenance. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_MESH_OUTPUT_GUI_OK ... result_deformed=true
  result_mesh_match=true displacement_range=true provenance=true ...`.
- The thirty-fifth Analyze checkpoint makes the turn-start state explicitly
  usable as an analysis workflow map. Each bounded analysis summary now joins
  its exact member graph to compact generated-mesh, runnable-solver, result,
  and graph-readiness summaries with explicit truncation metadata. The
  host-owned background manager additively exposes only its newest matching
  document job to the snapshot builder, which publishes phase, bounded
  progress, cancellation, terminal error, and final solver/result identities
  without copying execution stages, files, or result arrays into context.
  When no solver job exists the status is explicitly idle. The compiled dual-
  implementation solver lifecycle observes both active and completed job
  state, a ready graph, generated mesh, two solver definitions, and published
  result identity while asserting that `NodeNumbers` and
  `DisplacementVectors` never enter provider context. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_SOLVER_EXECUTION_GUI_OK ... job_status=true
  workflow_readiness=true concise_snapshot=true ...` and remains responsive.
- The thirty-sixth Analyze checkpoint closes the complete shipped surface
  rather than inferring completion from its individual families. The live
  production ribbon resolves all 104 current human actions plus 92 provider-
  eligible context actions to 30 capability families; every semantic action,
  exact-target type, transaction class, background requirement, definition,
  implementation, and runtime binding is checked before advertisement. Update
  variants now publish the exact target and editable fields directly instead
  of repeating those fields inside a generic `changes` object; exact variant
  validation and the runtime both reject target-only edits, unknown fields,
  stale state, and operation-specific mismatches before mutation. The complete
  schemas serialize to 117,148 bytes, below a guarded 120-KiB Analyze ceiling
  and nearly 14 KiB below the unchanged 128-KiB session transport ceiling;
  all other ribbons retain the 28-tool and 64-KiB defaults while Analyze has
  an explicit 32-tool bound. The compiled production gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ANALYZE_PROVIDER_SURFACE_GUI_OK actions=104 contexts=92
  tools=30 schemas=117148B exact_targets=true runtimes=true
  full_surface_call=true`. Current compiled lifecycle gates are green for
  analysis/materials; structural loads/supports/connections and background
  CalculiX execution; all thermal, fluid, and electromagnetic families;
  Gmsh/Netgen definitions, refinements, fields, transfinite controls, and
  responsive background generation/cancellation; equations and solver
  control; result display/inspection/purge; clipping; all nineteen post and
  visualization operations; and FEM-to-Mesh conversion including exact
  result-deformed output. Each applicable gate proves stale refusal,
  transaction ownership, undo/redo, bounded responses, and FCStd reopen
  persistence.

### 14. Implement the Manufacture surface

- The first Manufacture checkpoint establishes the bounded read foundation
  before any CAM mutation families are replicated. The live `CAM_Sanity`,
  `CAM_Inspect`, and `CAM_SelectLoop` actions now resolve to exact
  `validate_job`, `inspect_toolpath`, and `detect_loop` variants, while the
  task context adds an explicit paged `read_job` operation. Turn-start state
  exposes only public current model candidates and excludes the Job's model
  clones, stock, tools, tool-body features, origins, and other CAM-owned
  resources. Job hashes cover the complete ordered model/tool/operation graph
  and normalized durable settings without materializing every toolpath;
  explicit operation inspection fingerprints the complete placed command
  stream on demand and returns only a requested 1–128 command page. Sanity
  validation uses the native non-exporting validator, and loop inference
  returns typed exact face or edge names without changing GUI selection.
  Normalized fingerprints exclude transient recompute state and remain stable
  through FCStd reopen. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_INSPECT_GUI_OK job_state=true sanity=true
  toolpath_paging=true loop=true stale_rejection=true read_only=true
  reopen=true`; it also proves exact manifest/context wiring, a clean model
  candidate set, bounded schemas, no document objects, undo entries, or
  structural revisions from reads, and full stale-target refusal.
- The first Manufacture mutation checkpoint maps the shipped `CAM_Job` action
  to one exact `manufacture.job/create_job` operation. Its turn-start contract
  publishes exact model fingerprints, explicit current-visibility replacement
  decisions, and a path-free catalog of the same Job templates available to
  the human command. The request freezes the complete Job-creation environment,
  including every core factory preference and the selected template's opaque
  identity and content hash. Runtime creation calls the authoritative Path Job
  factory inside one SteveCAD-owned transaction, attaches the shipped Job view
  provider, and applies the same accepted replacement transition as the human
  dialog. Postconditions verify the exact model-clone mapping, stock, default
  tool, selection, public source states, replacement metadata, complete
  resource-owner graph, implicit Origin children, and one contiguous
  resource-first History block. The concise receipt returns the new Job state,
  template fingerprint, public replacements, and semantic resource count. The
  compiled lifecycle gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_JOB_GUI_OK
  exact_targets=true replacement=true resource_graph=true rollback=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true`; it proves catalog-template application,
  stale environment and visibility refusal, duplicate-input refusal, no
  mutation on failure, no task-panel launch, one-step undo/redo, and stable
  FCStd reopen. The focused Native suite passes 109 tests, Ruff and the compiled
  read gate remain green, and both protected Sketcher and PartDesign VibeScript
  integration gates pass unchanged.
- The tool/controller Manufacture checkpoint adds a path-free, content-addressed
  catalog with exact controller and ToolBit reads, typed editable ToolBit shape
  properties, and complete durable controller settings. The mutation surface
  creates controllers through the native CAM factory and updates controllers or
  their selected ToolBits only from frozen exact targets. ToolBit parameter
  changes update the existing imported parametric Body graph in place instead
  of replacing hidden resources, preserving every object identity, History
  enrollment, Job ownership, and downstream link while changing the actual
  cutter solid. Postconditions cover exact catalog hashes, target hashes,
  selection, document graph, visual-resource identity, shape validity, and
  semantic Job state. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_TOOL_GUI_OK catalog=true exact_targets=true
  controller_create=true controller_update=true tool_properties=true
  stable_resource_graph=true rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`.
  The inspect and Job gates remain green, the focused ribbon/registry suite is
  104/104 green, and the protected CAM VibeScript lifecycle passes on the real
  GUI thread. That protected gate also freezes source-replacement intent before
  native Job construction can change presentation, while preserving a human's
  decision to keep an already-hidden source hidden.
- The ToolBit output checkpoint maps `CAM_ToolBitSave` and
  `CAM_ToolBitSaveAs` to distinct `save` and `save_as` export variants. The
  provider selects only the bounded `fctb` or `yaml` format; a human-authorized
  output request owns the exact path, and no path is exposed in the schema or
  receipt. Preflight freezes the exact ToolBit target, native serialized bytes,
  definition hash, document graph, selection, undo count, transaction state,
  GUI modified state, and structural revision before authorization. Publication
  writes atomically through a private temporary file, verifies exact bytes and
  an isolated native ToolBit round trip, then returns only the file name, size,
  and hashes. The shared CAM serializer and Native summary readers now preserve
  legitimate pre-existing object state while removing only read-induced
  FeaturePython touches; the public controller reader freezes the linked ToolBit
  before the controller so an already-touched controller cannot contaminate the
  reported ToolBit state. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_TOOL_GUI_OK catalog=true exact_targets=true
  controller_create=true controller_update=true tool_properties=true
  stable_resource_graph=true save=true save_as=true path_private=true
  output_read_only=true rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The CAM
  inspect and Job gates, protected CAM VibeScript worker integration, 94 focused
  manifest/registry/snapshot tests, Ruff, byte compilation, staged-module build,
  and whitespace validation all remain green.
- The Profile checkpoint maps the shipped `CAM_Profile` action to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/profile` mutation. Its closed schema names the current
  Job, one Job-owned tool controller, either the complete Job model or exact
  public `FaceN`/`EdgeN` geometry, and every Profile, depth, height, and coolant
  value applied by this operation boundary. Preflight freezes the Job graph,
  controller, public-source geometry, subelement topology, History, selection,
  and document graph. Runtime uses the native Profile factory and authoritative
  `addBase` mapping, explicitly detaches SetupSheet expressions before applying
  requested depth and height values, attaches the shipped view provider without
  opening its task panel, and publishes one Job-owned History operation.
  Postconditions verify exact Job/controller/base ownership, every requested
  parameter, unchanged public sources and selection, complete native generation
  diagnostics, and at least one cutting command. Operation exact-state hashes
  retain the command-stream fingerprint while excluding redundant derived path
  measurements whose sub-tolerance values can change during FCStd serialization;
  those measurements remain available in the concise result. The compiled gate
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_PROFILE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  geometry=true parameters=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The Job, ToolBit, and CAM inspection gates
  remain green, the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes
  unchanged, and 144 focused registry, manifest, dispatch, snapshot, and state
  tests pass with Ruff, byte compilation, staged-module build, and whitespace
  validation green.
- The Pocket Shape checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Pocket_Shape` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/pocket_shape` mutation. The provider contract mirrors
  the real task page: one exact Job-owned controller, exact public Face or
  closed horizontal Edge geometry, a discriminated clearing pattern, cut mode,
  stepover, material allowance, outline/hole handling, rest-machining intent,
  depths, finish step, heights, coolant, and either no extensions or explicitly
  targeted face-edge extensions. It deliberately does not advertise
  `entire_job`: the shipped Pocket Shape proxy requires Base geometry and would
  otherwise return without generating a path. Preflight freezes the Job,
  controller, public model topology, selected elements, History, selection, and
  document graph; it rejects unsupported faces, open/non-horizontal edge sets,
  meaningless minimum-travel requests without a start point, invalid rest
  machining prerequisites, and extension edges that do not belong to the exact
  selected face. Runtime uses the shipped Pocket Shape and feature-extension
  factories, maps public model targets through authoritative Job resources,
  removes SetupSheet expressions before applying exact values, retains native
  extension encoding, attaches the shipped view provider without a task panel,
  and publishes exactly one History operation. Postconditions verify exact
  ownership, Base geometry, all process/depth/height values, extension links,
  generation diagnostics, cutting commands, unchanged sources and selection,
  and a stable durable operation fingerprint. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_POCKET_SHAPE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  geometry=true extensions=true parameters=true toolpath=true history=true
  rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. Profile, Job, ToolBit, and CAM
  inspection compiled gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript
  API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; and 127 focused registry, manifest,
  capability, context, dispatch, and state tests pass with Ruff, byte
  compilation, staged-module build, and whitespace validation green.
- The Mill Facing checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_MillFacing` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/mill_facing` mutation. Its closed provider contract
  names one exact Job and Job-owned controller, then exposes only the controls
  on the current Mill Facing and shared depth, height, coolant, and linking
  task pages: cut mode, clearing pattern, angle, reversal, stepover, axial
  stock allowance, pass and stock extensions, depths, heights, collision
  strategy, and collision clearance. The provider does not request artificial
  Base geometry because the shipped operation always machines the Job stock's
  highest upward face. Preflight freezes the complete Job model graph,
  controller, stock solid, selected stock top face, History, selection, and
  document graph; it proves the extended stock boundary, positive tool
  diameter, effective final depth, and any strategy-specific tool resource
  before mutation. Runtime uses the shipped Mill Facing factory and view
  provider without opening a task panel, removes SetupSheet expressions before
  applying exact values, and publishes exactly one Job-owned History operation.
  Postconditions verify every requested control, exact stock and model hashes,
  ownership, empty Base, successful native generation diagnostics, cutting
  commands, unchanged sources and selection, and a concise durable operation
  state. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_MILL_FACING_GUI_OK exact_targets=true stock=true
  parameters=true linking=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. Profile, Pocket Shape, Job, ToolBit, and CAM
  inspection compiled gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript
  API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; and 144 focused registry, manifest,
  capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass. Ruff, Python
  compilation, staged-module build, source/build parity, and whitespace
  validation are green.
- The Helix checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Helix` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/helix` mutation. Its closed schema accepts an exact
  Job-owned controller and ordered circular Face/Edge features, then exposes
  only the controls on the current hole-geometry, Helix, depth, height,
  linking, and coolant task pages: automatic or manual feature ordering,
  inside/outside start, cut mode, pitch and ramp limits, stepover, outer radial
  stock allowance, depths, heights, collision strategy, and coolant. Hidden
  legacy/expert Helix properties are fixed to the same deterministic behavior
  as a freshly accepted human operation instead of being leaked into the
  provider contract. Preflight freezes the Job, controller, public-source
  topology, every selected feature, History, selection, and document graph; it
  calls the shipped drillable-feature predicate, derives exact centers and
  diameters, rejects duplicate hole centers and cutter/allowance combinations
  that the native generator would silently skip, and validates linking
  resources before mutation. Runtime uses the shipped Helix factory,
  authoritative public-to-Job Base mapping, and shipped view provider without
  opening a task panel; it removes SetupSheet expressions before applying
  exact values and publishes one Job-owned History operation. Postconditions
  verify Base order, every visible value, deterministic hidden state, derived
  spindle direction, successful native diagnostics, cutting commands,
  unchanged sources and selection, and stable operation state. The compiled
  lifecycle gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_HELIX_GUI_OK
  exact_targets=true features=true order=true parameters=true linking=true
  toolpath=true history=true rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`.
  All six earlier Manufacture compiled gates remain green; the protected CAM
  VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; and 144 focused registry,
  manifest, capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass.
  Ruff, Python compilation, staged-module build, source/build parity, and
  whitespace validation are green.
- The Adaptive checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Adaptive` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/adaptive` mutation. Its closed schema accepts an
  exact Job-owned controller and exact Face/Edge regions, then exposes the
  current human task-panel surface as distinct process, helix-entry, depth,
  height, face-extension, and coolant groups. That includes inside/outside
  region choice, clearing/profiling, the human accuracy range, fractional
  stepover, cleared-link lift and keep-down ratio, XY stock allowance,
  inside-out clearing, finishing, outline and rest-machining controls, every
  helix-entry limit, finish step, and explicit extensions. The hidden
  model-aware experiment, Z allowance, region ordering, stop/cache state,
  workplane, and locations are fixed to deterministic fresh-operation state
  rather than leaked into the provider contract. Preflight requires the
  shipped libarea `Adaptive2d` engine before mutation; freezes the Job, stock,
  cutter, public-source topology, selected elements, extension geometry,
  History, selection, and document graph; validates a positive cutter and
  solid stock; proves each face has a usable XY projection; requires Edge
  selections to form closed horizontal wires; validates extension membership;
  and rejects rest machining without an earlier active cutting path. Runtime
  uses the shipped Adaptive factory, authoritative public-to-Job Base mapping,
  shared exact extension boundary, and shipped view provider without opening
  a task panel; removes SetupSheet expressions, publishes one Job-owned History
  operation, and leaves the human selection unchanged. Postconditions verify
  every requested value, deterministic hidden state, exact Base and extension
  links, libarea input/output caches, native generation diagnostics, cutting
  commands, source preservation, and stable operation state. Pocket Shape now
  uses the same reusable extension boundary and remains lifecycle-green. The
  compiled gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_ADAPTIVE_GUI_OK
  exact_targets=true regions=true parameters=true helix_entry=true
  extensions=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. All seven earlier Manufacture compiled gates remain green; the
  protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; and 144
  focused registry, manifest, capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and
  state tests pass. Ruff, Python compilation, staged-module build,
  source/build parity, and whitespace validation are green.
- The Slot checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Slot` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/slot` mutation. Its closed path contract separates
  custom points, one Edge, one horizontal Face, one vertical Face, two
  vertices, two Edges, and two vertical Faces so each mode advertises only its
  valid exact targets and reference controls. It also exposes the current Slot,
  depth, height, and coolant task-page values: start/end path extensions,
  start-to-end or perpendicular orientation, directional or bidirectional
  layers, direction reversal, depths, safe and clearance heights, and coolant.
  Hidden radius-extension, temporary-object, and custom-start-point state is
  fixed to deterministic fresh-operation values rather than added to the
  provider contract. Preflight freezes the Job, controller, complete Job model,
  exact selected topology, solid stock, History, selection, and document graph;
  validates a positive cutter; proves the geometric requirements of every path
  mode; and rejects stale targets, vertical single Edges, degenerate reference
  points, invalid face orientation, and unsupported feature combinations before
  mutation. Runtime uses the shipped Slot factory, authoritative public-to-Job
  Base mapping, and shipped view provider without opening a task panel; clears
  SetupSheet expressions, supports both feature-derived and explicit paths, and
  publishes exactly one Job-owned History operation. Postconditions verify the
  exact Base resource, every visible setting, deterministic hidden state,
  resolved endpoints, native generation diagnostics, cutting commands,
  unchanged sources and selection, and stable operation state. The compiled
  lifecycle gate uses separate solid stock and reusable guide geometry and
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_SLOT_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  feature_path=true custom_points=true parameters=true toolpath=true
  history=true rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All eight earlier
  Manufacture gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker
  lifecycle passes unchanged; and 144 focused registry, manifest, capability,
  context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass. Ruff, Python compilation,
  staged-module build, source/build parity, and whitespace validation are green.
- The Drilling checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Drilling` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/drilling` mutation. Its closed target union accepts
  ordered exact circular Face/Edge features with an explicit enabled state,
  explicit XY hole locations, or both, while automatic/manual ordering remains
  explicit. A discriminated process contract separates drilling from tapping,
  and a second closed union exposes only the controls belonging to standard,
  peck/chip-break, dwell, and feed-retract cycles. Drill-tip depth extension,
  G98/G99 retraction, depths, heights, linking, and coolant match the shipped
  task pages; later start/end sorting controls remain fixed to deterministic
  fresh-operation state. Preflight freezes the Job, exact controller, complete
  Job model, every public feature and selected subelement, History, selection,
  and the document graph. It uses the shipped drillable-feature predicate,
  preserves disabled feature identity, rejects duplicate models, subelements,
  and enabled hole centers, and proves drill-tip and tapping tool requirements
  before mutation. CAM's shared operation constructor now accepts an optional
  exact controller, validates it as an eligible resource of the parent Job,
  and installs it before default generation; every already-exposed Native CAM
  factory uses this path, so multi-controller Jobs never invoke an interactive
  chooser or temporarily bind an unrelated controller. Existing callers retain
  their original fallback behavior when no exact controller is supplied.
  Runtime uses the shipped unified Drilling/Tapping factory and view provider
  without opening a task panel, maps exact public resources into Base and
  Locations, clears SetupSheet expressions, and publishes one Job-owned History
  operation. Postconditions verify exact controller, Base order and enablement,
  locations, sorting, process and cycle settings, deterministic hidden state,
  native generation diagnostics, one expected canned cycle per enabled hole,
  unchanged sources and selection, and stable operation state. The compiled
  lifecycle gate uses real shipped Drill and Tap tool bits and emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_DRILLING_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  feature_enablement=true locations=true drilling=true tapping=true cycles=true
  parameters=true linking=true coolant=true toolpath=true history=true
  rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All nine earlier Manufacture
  gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes
  unchanged; and 144 focused registry, manifest, capability, context, dispatch,
  snapshot, and state tests pass. New Native sources pass Ruff and Python
  compilation, staged modules match source, and whitespace validation is green.
- The Thread Milling checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_ThreadMilling` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/thread_milling` mutation. Its closed target contract
  accepts ordered exact circular Face/Edge features with explicit enablement
  and automatic/manual sorting. A discriminated thread definition accepts
  either a custom internal/external thread with explicit major/minor diameter
  and metric pitch or integer TPI, or one exact designation and fit percentage
  from the seven shipped imperial and metric thread series. The existing
  `manufacture.inspect` read surface now provides bounded, filtered paging over
  those authoritative catalogs, including diameter ranges and pitch/TPI, so the
  provider never has to guess one of roughly six hundred designations.
  Orientation, climb/conventional direction, pass count, lead-in/out, depths,
  heights, linking, and coolant match the human geometry, operation, depth, and
  height pages. Preflight freezes the Job, exact thread-mill controller,
  complete Job model, every selected feature, History, selection, and document
  graph; resolves standard dimensions from the shipped CSV row and fit; proves
  circular target identity and distinct enabled centers; validates cutter
  diameter, Crest, cutting angle, and linking resources; computes every radial
  pass; and rejects impossible modeled stock before mutation. Runtime uses the
  shipped Thread Milling factory and view provider without opening a task panel,
  enters the exact controller through the constructor, preserves disabled
  features, clears SetupSheet expressions, fixes unused sorting endpoints and
  clearance-operation state deterministically, and publishes one Job-owned
  History operation. Postconditions verify the controller, Base order and
  enablement, resolved thread values, all visible settings, hidden state,
  generated entry locations and helical command direction for every enabled
  target and pass, native generation diagnostics, unchanged sources and
  selection, and stable operation state. The compiled lifecycle gate uses the
  shipped 5 mm thread mill, a real bored plate and boss, a catalog-backed M10 x
  1.5 internal thread, and a custom 20-TPI external thread. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_THREAD_MILLING_GUI_OK catalog=true
  exact_targets=true feature_enablement=true standard=true custom=true
  parameters=true linking=true coolant=true toolpath=true history=true
  rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All ten earlier Manufacture
  gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes
  unchanged; and 144 focused registry, manifest, capability, context, dispatch,
  snapshot, and state tests pass. New Native sources pass Ruff and Python
  compilation, staged modules match source, and whitespace validation is green.
- The Engrave checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Engrave` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/engrave` mutation. Its closed geometry contract
  separates the complete Job, ordered exact zero-volume wire models, and
  ordered exact Edges, while the operation contract exposes the human-visible
  start vertex, depths, heights, linking strategy, collision clearance, and
  coolant. Reverse, cut pattern, approximation, sorting, and sorting endpoints
  are fixed to deterministic fresh-operation values instead of leaking hidden
  state into the provider surface. Preflight freezes the Job, exact controller,
  public source geometry, History, selection, and document graph; proves whole
  models are usable zero-volume wires; assembles exact selected Edges into
  wires; and rejects a start vertex outside any selected closed wire before
  mutation rather than accepting the shipped generator's silent clamp. Runtime
  uses the shipped Engrave factory and view provider without opening a task
  panel, installs the exact controller through the constructor, maps selected
  public geometry to the authoritative Job resource, and publishes one
  Job-owned History operation. CAM's shared engraving generator now copies
  every borrowed input wire, Job collision shape, and tool shape before OCC
  sorting, orientation, or collision work, preventing Engrave, Deburr, and
  V-carve path generation from mutating linked public topology. Postconditions
  verify exact Base or BaseShapes representation, every visible setting,
  deterministic hidden state, expressions, processed wire count, native
  generation diagnostics, cutting commands, unchanged source fingerprints and
  selection, and stable operation state. Source-preservation failures identify
  the exact model plus expected and observed shape hashes. The compiled
  lifecycle gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_ENGRAVE_GUI_OK
  exact_targets=true edges=true whole_models=true entire_job=true
  parameters=true linking=true coolant=true toolpath=true history=true
  rollback=true sources_preserved=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All
  eleven earlier Manufacture gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript
  API/worker publication lifecycle passes unchanged; 144 focused registry,
  manifest, capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass; and
  the shared CAM linking generator and Deburr suites pass 19 tests with two
  intentional linking skips. New Native sources pass Ruff and Python
  compilation, staged modules match source, and whitespace validation is green.
- The Deburr checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Deburr` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/deburr` mutation. Its closed geometry contract accepts
  ordered exact Edge/Face features from distinct Job-owned public models. The
  process contract exposes chamfer width, extra tool immersion, clockwise or
  counterclockwise direction, optional step-down, safe and clearance heights,
  linking strategy, collision clearance, and coolant, matching the human Base,
  Depths, Heights, and Deburr pages. Hidden Join and EntryPoint state is fixed
  to Round and zero; Side remains an inspected derived result. Preflight freezes
  the Job, exact controller, public feature topology, History, selection, and
  document graph; requires direct Edges to lie in one horizontal XY plane;
  accepts upward planar Faces and side/chamfer Faces with a supported lower
  horizontal boundary; rejects downward planar Faces; proves safe height above
  the selected geometry; validates linking resources; and checks cutter
  diameter, cutting angle, tip radius, cutting-edge height, and the radial/depth
  capacity needed for the requested chamfer before mutation. Runtime uses the
  shipped Deburr factory and view provider without opening a task panel,
  installs the exact controller through the constructor, maps public features
  to authoritative Job resources, clears SetupSheet expressions, and publishes
  one Job-owned History operation. The shipped Deburr generator now extracts
  and offsets geometry from an owned shape copy, complementing the shared
  engraving generator's owned wire/collision copies so no linked public source
  topology is translated or reversed. Postconditions verify exact Base state,
  every visible value, deterministic hidden state, derived Side, generated base
  and offset wires, native generation diagnostics, depth-bearing cutting moves,
  source preservation, unchanged selection, and stable operation state. The
  compiled lifecycle gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_DEBURR_GUI_OK
  exact_targets=true edges=true faces=true cutter_capacity=true parameters=true
  linking=true coolant=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true
  sources_preserved=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All twelve earlier
  Manufacture gates remain green; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker
  publication lifecycle passes unchanged; 144 focused registry, manifest,
  capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass; and the shared
  CAM linking generator and Deburr suites pass 19 tests with two intentional
  linking skips. New Native sources pass Ruff and Python compilation, staged
  modules match source, and whitespace validation is green.
- The V-carve checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Vcarve` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/v_carve` mutation. Its closed geometry contract
  separates ordered exact horizontal Faces from ordered exact zero-volume
  face-bearing Job models and requires one exact V-bit controller. The process
  contract exposes discretization deflection, colinear filtering, movement
  optimization, discriminated finishing-pass state and offset, final depth,
  step-down, safe and clearance heights, and coolant. Start depth is derived
  from the frozen Face plane because the shipped generator derives and uses
  that value rather than consuming the generic task-page field; Workplane and
  geometry tolerance are captured as deterministic hidden state. Preflight
  freezes the Job, controller, public geometry, History, selection, and graph;
  constructs a real Voronoi diagram for every copied Face; requires valid,
  closed, nondegenerate, coplanar XY regions; rejects volumetric whole models;
  proves safe-height and final-depth relationships; and validates V-bit
  diameter, tip diameter, cutting-edge angle, maximum radial carve depth, and
  finishing placement before mutation. Runtime uses the shipped V-carve
  factory and view provider without opening a task panel, installs the exact
  controller through the constructor, publishes either exact Base Faces or
  exact Job-resource BaseShapes, clears SetupSheet expressions, and creates one
  Job-owned History operation. The shipped generator now copies every borrowed
  Face before Voronoi processing so linked public topology cannot be changed.
  Postconditions verify the exact geometry representation, every visible and
  hidden value, expressions, one medial result per frozen Face, raw Voronoi
  results, depth-bearing cutting moves, exact Job/controller/source state,
  unchanged selection, and stable operation identity. The compiled lifecycle
  gate emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_V_CARVE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  faces=true whole_models=true v_bit=true parameters=true toolpath=true
  history=true rollback=true sources_preserved=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. All thirteen earlier Manufacture gates pass sequentially; the
  protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; the shipped
  V-carve suite passes 15 tests; and 144 focused registry, manifest,
  capability, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass. New Native
  sources pass Ruff and Python compilation, staged modules match source, and
  whitespace validation is green.
- The Pocket 3D checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Pocket3D` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/pocket_3d` mutation. Its closed contract accepts one
  exact CAM Job, its exact controller, and ordered exact Faces or complete
  horizontal Edge loops. It exposes only the human Pocket controls: cut mode;
  Offset, ZigZag, ZigZagOffset, Line, or Grid pattern with an angle only when
  applicable; stepover; pass extension; rest machining; automatic or exact
  picked start point with optional minimum-travel routing; explicit start
  depth, step-down, finish step, safe and clearance heights; and coolant. The
  final depth remains correctly absent from the provider schema because the
  shipped operation derives that read-only value from its selected features.
  Preflight freezes the Job, controller, public source topology, History,
  selection, and document graph; mirrors the shipped feature-depth algorithm;
  requires the explicit start plane at or above the derived source top and
  above the derived floor; validates a positive cutter and effective stepover;
  and rejects stale targets, unsupported Faces, open Edge chains, mixed
  Face/Edge items, and rest machining without an earlier active cutting path
  before mutation. A shared Pocket geometry validator now gives Pocket Shape
  and Pocket 3D the same exact supported-face and closed-loop boundary. Runtime
  uses the shipped Pocket factory and view provider without opening a task
  panel, installs the exact controller through the additive factory argument,
  clears SetupSheet expressions, fixes hidden fresh-operation state, and
  publishes one Job-owned History operation. The shipped Pocket engine now
  performs OCC work on owned source/stock copies and sorts arbitrary selected
  Edges into connected closed wires before making faces, fixing manual and
  Native Edge-loop pockets without adding a file-specific path. Postconditions
  verify exact Base resources, every visible and hidden setting, expressions,
  derived depths, effective modal cutting depth within the engine's one-micron
  floor epsilon, valid removal volume, generation diagnostics, Job ownership,
  unchanged source topology and selection, and History identity. Lifecycle
  checks preserve exact persistent settings and machining invariants while
  correctly allowing the shipped greedy minimum-travel sorter to choose an
  equivalent route ordering after recomputation. The compiled gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_POCKET_3D_GUI_OK exact_targets=true faces=true
  edge_loops=true parameters=true derived_depth=true rest_machining=true
  toolpath=true history=true rollback=true sources_preserved=true undo=true
  redo=true reopen=true`. All fifteen Manufacture gates pass sequentially; the
  protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged; the shipped
  Pocket suite passes 4 tests; and 152 focused registry, manifest, capability,
  context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass. New Native sources pass
  Ruff and Python compilation, staged modules match source, both touched build
  targets are green, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The optional Surface checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Surface` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/surface` mutation only when the human action is
  genuinely available through the advanced OCL preference and runtime. Its
  closed contract accepts either the complete Job or ordered exact public
  Faces, including an explicit count of trailing avoidance Faces. Discriminated
  contracts cover Line/ZigZag angles, Offset, Circular/Circular ZigZag, and
  Spiral centers; single- or multi-pass layers; Job-model or stock bounds;
  conventional/climb direction; stepover, sampling, profile-edge behavior,
  boundary adjustment/enforcement, internal-feature handling, collective or
  individual features, reversal, optimization, automatic or exact starts,
  mesh deflection, depths, heights, and coolant. It deliberately remains a
  planar operation: the separately shipped Rotary Surface action retains its
  own row and contract. Preflight freezes the Job, exact controller, public
  source topology, ordered Faces, stock, History, selection, and document
  graph; validates OCL availability and cutter translation; derives source top
  and operation floor; rejects unsafe depths and invalid Face/avoidance
  combinations; and estimates drop-cutter sampling before mutation. Requests
  above the explicit 250,000-sample synchronous ceiling fail with a corrective
  workload error, preventing this task-free path from entering an unbounded UI
  operation. Runtime uses the shipped Surface factory and view provider without
  opening a task panel, installs the exact controller during construction,
  clears SetupSheet expressions, fixes planar/hidden rotary state, and
  publishes one Job-owned History operation. The shared Surface engine now
  copies every borrowed Job model, stock, selected Face, shell, and
  tessellation input before projection, Boolean, translation, and mesh work,
  preventing both human and automated Surface generation from mutating linked
  public topology. Postconditions verify every exposed and fixed setting,
  exact ownership and Base order, native generation diagnostics, cutting
  commands and Z range, unchanged sources and selection, and durable operation
  state. The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_SURFACE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true faces=true
  avoidance=true entire_job=true patterns=true layers=true quality=true
  bounded_work=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true
  sources_preserved=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. All sixteen Native
  Manufacture lifecycle gates pass sequentially; the protected CAM VibeScript
  API/worker publication lifecycle passes unchanged; the 15-test shipped Rotary
  Surface suite and 152 focused registry, manifest, capability, context,
  dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass. New Native sources pass Ruff and
  Python compilation, touched modules are staged by their build targets, and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The optional Waterline checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Waterline` to the exact
  `manufacture.operation/waterline` mutation only while the human action is
  genuinely available through the advanced OCL preference and runtime. Its
  closed provider contract exposes three explicit algorithm branches: OCL
  drop-cutter with exact bounds, sampling, and mesh deflection; OCL adaptive
  with sampling, minimum sampling, linear optimization, and mesh deflection;
  and Experimental with exact bounds, boundary adjustment, ignore-above
  height, and discriminated waterline-only, every-layer, or final-layer
  clearing. Every clearing pattern is independently discriminated, and the
  remaining exact controls cover cut direction, single- or multi-pass layers,
  depth offset, boundary enforcement, internal-feature behavior, collective or
  individual feature handling, pass reversal, transition/gap optimization,
  automatic or exact starts, depths, heights, and coolant. The contract and
  runtime state the shipped engine's real geometry rule instead of hiding it:
  exact selected Faces and trailing avoidance Faces are accepted only by OCL
  Adaptive; Dropcutter and Experimental require the entire exact Job because
  the underlying engine otherwise silently ignores selected Faces. Impossible
  combinations now fail before transaction start with a corrective
  `geometry.kind=entire_job` instruction.
- Waterline preflight freezes the Job, controller, public source topology,
  ordered Faces, stock, History, selection, and document graph; validates OCL
  availability and exact cutter translation; derives the source top and
  operation floor; rejects stale targets, invalid Face/avoidance combinations,
  adaptive minimum-sample inversions, out-of-range Experimental ignore heights,
  and depths below stock; and estimates algorithm-specific processing work.
  Requests above the explicit 250,000-cell synchronous ceiling fail with a
  corrective workload error before document or UI mutation. Runtime uses the
  shipped Waterline factory and view provider without a task panel, installs
  the exact controller during construction, clears SetupSheet expressions, and
  publishes one Job-owned History operation. The shared OCL preparation layer
  copies borrowed model, stock, selected-Face, envelope, shell, region, and
  tessellation inputs before geometric work. The shipped Waterline factory now
  accepts an additive controller argument, envelope generation no longer owns
  its caller's shape, and final-layer clearing no longer overwrites the durable
  requested `CutPattern` while generating.
- Postconditions verify the full retained parameter set, exact controller and
  ordered Base ownership, native generation diagnostics, nonempty cutting
  motion, cutting Z range, unchanged public sources and selection, and durable
  Job/History enrollment. Adaptive regeneration is checked by exact settings,
  populated command structure, and spatial bounds while permitting equivalent
  closed-contour routing to change rapid-link distance; deterministic
  Dropcutter and Experimental paths retain the stricter length comparison. The
  compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_WATERLINE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true faces=true
  avoidance=true entire_job=true algorithms=true clearing=true parameters=true
  bounded_work=true toolpath=true history=true rollback=true
  sources_preserved=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true` and passes repeatedly.
  All seventeen Native Manufacture lifecycle gates are green; the protected CAM
  VibeScript API/worker publication lifecycle passes unchanged; the shipped
  Rotary Surface suite passes 15 tests; and 153 focused registry, manifest,
  capability, common-read, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state tests pass.
  New Native sources pass Ruff and Python compilation, touched modules are
  staged by their build targets, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The optional Rotary Surface checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_RotarySurface` to
  the exact `manufacture.operation/rotary_surface` mutation only while the
  human action is genuinely present through the advanced and experimental OCL
  preferences. Its closed contract requires one exact Job and controller, the
  complete configured machine definition, one exact cylindrical stock, the
  Job's sole exact model, and either the entire Job or ordered exact Faces.
  Spiral, Parallel, and Rings are separate discriminated pattern schemas so
  pitch, surface stepover, and ring spacing cannot be confused. The remaining
  explicit settings cover climb or conventional cutting, stock-derived or
  exact axial bounds, sampling resolution, radial allowance, single or
  multi-pass depth, surface-speed or axial-only feed, a nonzero effective-feed
  ceiling, mesh quality, safe and clearance heights, and coolant.
- Rotary preflight binds the external machine configuration into the Job's
  exact state hash and rejects same-name machine-file drift, missing or
  unsupported rotary axes, misaligned/non-cylinder stock, multiple Job models,
  off-axis geometry, stale Faces or controller, unsafe clearance, invalid
  modulo ranges, and generated unwound travel outside machine limits. Face
  bounds reject Spiral and the shipped conventional-direction case where the
  native generator cannot honor the requested angular sector. Algorithmic work
  is bounded before mutation by explicit OCL-cell and generated-command
  ceilings. Runtime uses the shipped factory with an additive exact-controller
  argument, opens no task panel, publishes one Job-owned History operation,
  and verifies every retained setting plus fully qualified XYZA/B cutting
  motion and the machine wrap strategy. Selected-Face tessellation now works
  on owned OCC copies, preventing Rotary generation from attaching mesh data
  to a public model source.
- The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_ROTARY_SURFACE_GUI_OK exact_targets=true
  exact_machine=true cylinder_stock=true faces=true spiral=true parallel=true
  rings=true climb=true conventional=true feed_modes=true bounded_work=true
  toolpath=true history=true rollback=true sources_preserved=true undo=true
  redo=true reopen=true` and passes repeatedly. CAM state fingerprints now
  distinguish authored settings from expression-evaluated and read-only
  recompute caches, remaining stable when an FCStd reload canonicalizes stock
  bounds. All eighteen Manufacture lifecycle gates pass; Pocket 3D's gate
  validates exact feed count, cutting envelope, and per-depth coverage while
  permitting only the shipped Area engine's harmless greedy link rerouting.
  The protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged, the
  shipped Rotary Surface suite passes all 15 tests, and 165 focused registry,
  manifest, capability, common-read, context, dispatch, snapshot, and state
  tests pass. New and touched Python sources pass Ruff and compilation, build
  staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Active/Inactive checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_OpActiveToggle` to the
  dedicated `manufacture.modify` `set_active` variant. Its closed contract
  takes one exact Job hash and one through 64 distinct operation-group entries,
  each with an observed and explicit desired boolean state. It never exposes a
  retry-unsafe blind toggle. Preflight rejects stale or wrong-Job operations,
  redundant requests, future or suppressed History inputs, malformed CAM
  graphs, and incomplete groups of aliases sharing one underlying dress-up
  base. Mutation changes each unique base once, performs an exact dependency
  recompute, and proves that object membership, ordered Job operations,
  History position/visibility/suppression, human selection, view visibility,
  authored operation configuration, and unrelated Job resources did not
  change. Success returns only changed operation names, prior/current states,
  command counts, the refreshed exact Job hash, and bounded counts plus the
  normal transaction receipt.
- Effective CAM state now follows dress-up bases, and the shipped human helper
  identifies dress-ups from their proxy type instead of requiring `Dressup` in
  an editable object name. The compiled gate therefore covers both a regular
  operation and a renamed Array dress-up, including the exact underlying base,
  batched deactivation, selective reactivation, stale/no-change rejection,
  forced postcondition rollback, selection and visibility preservation,
  unchanged History, undo, redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_OPERATION_ACTIVE_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  explicit_states=true batch=true dressup=true rollback=true selection=true
  visibility=true history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped
  human toggle test and Manufacture inspection lifecycle pass, 153 focused
  registry/manifest/capability/context/dispatch/snapshot/state tests pass, and
  the protected GUI CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources pass
  Ruff, Python compilation, build staging, and whitespace validation.
- The Operation Copy checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_OperationCopy` to the
  dedicated `manufacture.modify` `copy_operations` variant. Its closed contract
  accepts one through eight exact Job targets and one through 64 distinct
  operation names in total; every Job carries its observed state hash, and the
  model cannot invent output names or address objects through GUI selection.
  Preflight rejects stale Jobs, wrong-Job operations, duplicates, inactive or
  future History inputs, malformed or incomplete dress-up graphs, and semantic
  source closures larger than the bounded copy budget before mutation starts.
- Human and Native copy now share one GUI-independent CAM graph primitive. It
  copies the complete semantic operation closure, preserves public sources,
  removes copied replacement metadata, assigns copied resources to exactly one
  copied operation, and adopts the new graph at the current History marker.
  Multiple copied operations receive one hidden ownership controller so the
  human-visible operations remain distinct while undo, redo, suppression, and
  save/reopen retain one stable action identity. The existing three-argument
  `Document.copyObject` ABI and default timeline adoption remain unchanged; an
  additive four-argument overload permits this domain to defer adoption until
  copied metadata has been made valid.
- Native postconditions prove exact Job parenting, closure ownership, durable
  configuration equivalence through the source-to-copy object map, identical
  generated toolpath semantics apart from graph-authored label comments,
  unchanged source graphs, unchanged existing History and Job resources,
  preserved selection and visibility, valid recomputation, and precise marker
  insertion. The compiled lifecycle gate covers single and batched copies, an
  Array dress-up with its base, stale rejection, forced rollback, assistant
  undo, redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_OPERATION_COPY_GUI_OK exact_jobs=true stale=true
  rollback=true single=true dressup=true batch=true source_preserved=true
  history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. The shipped human copy, dress-up ownership, multi-copy,
  rollback, marker insertion, and owned-resource regressions pass; Manufacture
  inspection emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_INSPECT_GUI_OK` with read-only
  revision preservation; 153 focused contract tests pass; and the unchanged
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`.
- The Operation Array checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_Array` to the dedicated
  `manufacture.operation/array` mutation. Its closed contract takes one exact
  Job hash and one through 64 ordered exact operation-state targets, then one
  discriminated Linear-1D, Linear-2D, Polar, or Points pattern. The model must
  explicitly provide reverse ordering and either disabled jitter or a complete
  seeded jitter definition; it cannot infer bases, point geometry, controller,
  or pattern settings from GUI selection. Points patterns use exact current
  shape hashes, explicit Vertex/Edge/Face subelements, an explicit global,
  whole-source, or subelement origin, and bounded automatic or manual sorting.
- Preflight requires every base to be one active, valid, current operation in
  the exact Job, with a nonempty cutting path, one shared current controller,
  and coolant disabled as required by the shipped generator. It rejects stale
  Job, base, point-source, and subelement state; duplicate or wrong-Job bases;
  ineffective patterns; and any request whose conservative output exceeds 256
  point placements or 500,000 commands. Human and Native creation share one
  task-free `Path.Op.Gui.Array.Create` factory while retaining the existing
  command and defaults. Jitter now uses an operation-local seeded generator via
  an additive constructor parameter, preserving deterministic output without
  changing Python's process-global random state.
- Postconditions prove the exact ordered bases, controller, pattern, point
  links, jitter values, output repeat and cutting-command counts, source graph,
  Job resources, selection, visibility, and marker-aware History insertion.
  The compiled lifecycle gate exercises stale and workload rejection, forced
  rollback, Linear-1D, reversed Linear-2D, Polar, Points, repeated seeded
  jitter, assistant undo, redo, insertion before future History, and FCStd
  reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_OPERATION_ARRAY_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_bases=true stale=true bounded_work=true rollback=true linear_1d=true
  linear_2d=true polar=true points=true seeded_jitter=true
  source_preserved=true history=true receipt=true marker=true selection=true
  visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped human Array
  atomicity and forced-failure rollback regressions pass, Manufacture inspection
  remains read-only, all 153 focused contract tests pass, and the final-code
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`.
- The Simple Copy checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_SimpleCopy` to the dedicated
  `manufacture.operation/simple_copy` mutation with exact target type
  `ExactCamJobPlacedToolpathFlatteningSet`. Its closed contract accepts one
  exact Job state and one through 64 ordered, distinct, exact source-operation
  states. Preflight requires every source to be one active, valid, current,
  nonempty operation-group entry in that Job; requires one shared current tool
  controller and coolant mode; freezes each source's fully placed command
  stream; and rejects stale targets or streams exceeding 500,000 commands,
  16 MiB in aggregate, or 4,096 bytes for one command before mutation starts.
- Human and Native Simple Copy now share one task-free
  `Path.Op.Gui.SimpleCopy.Create` factory. The exact frozen stream is stored in
  a source-preserving, non-parametric Custom operation with no source links.
  An additive `ObjectEmbeddedPath` proxy and default-false CAM operation hook
  identify command streams that already own their coolant state, preventing
  the generic Custom generator from duplicating source `M8`/`M9` commands;
  ordinary Custom operations retain their existing coolant generation. Native
  postconditions prove the precise proxy, Job, controller, coolant, label,
  durable G-code hash, entire executable command sequence including wrappers,
  source state, Job resources, selection, visibility, and marker-aware History
  insertion.
- The compiled lifecycle gate covers stale and incompatible-source rejection,
  forced postcondition rollback, single and multiple placed-source flattening,
  absence of source links, exact source preservation, assistant receipt,
  selection and visibility preservation, undo, redo, insertion before future
  History, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_SIMPLE_COPY_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_sources=true stale=true compatibility=true rollback=true single=true
  multi=true placements=true flattened=true no_source_links=true
  source_preserved=true history=true marker=true receipt=true selection=true
  visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped human CAM
  atomicity and forced-failure rollback regressions pass, 177 focused
  registry/manifest/capability/context/dispatch/snapshot/state tests pass,
  Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen, and the final-code
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. New Native and shared
  Simple Copy sources pass Ruff, all touched Python sources compile, build
  staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Array dress-up checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupArray` to the dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/array_dressup` replacement mutation with exact target type
  `ExactCamJobOperationAndArrayDressupPattern`. Its closed contract accepts one
  exact Job and one exact current base operation plus one discriminated
  Linear-1D, Linear-2D, or Polar pattern. Optional Linear jitter is explicit,
  bounded, and seeded; Polar rejects jitter because the shipped generator does
  not implement it. Preflight requires an active, valid, nonempty base at the
  exact Job-group position, freezes its controller, coolant, configuration, and
  path, computes the complete expected result without mutation, and rejects
  more than 256 placements or 500,000 output commands.
- Human and Native Array dress-up creation now share one caller-transaction
  factory while retaining the existing command and public `Create` entry point.
  The generator uses an operation-local random source, preserving repeatable
  seeded output without mutating Python's process-global random state. Native
  publication retains the exact hidden base, replaces it in the Job group,
  inserts the dress-up at the active History marker, and publishes exact
  replacement metadata. The shared timeline publisher now derives the hidden
  end state of typed replacement inputs from that metadata after all graph and
  identity validation; this gives every replacement domain one atomic,
  marker-safe publication rule instead of Python-side History patching.
- Postconditions prove the exact proxy, base link, Job, controller, coolant,
  authored pattern and jitter values, output path and count, source
  configuration and toolpath, Job resources, exact group replacement,
  selection, visibility, and marker-aware History state. The compiled lifecycle
  gate exercises stale and bounded-work rejection, forced rollback, Linear-1D,
  Linear-2D, Polar, repeated seeded jitter, process-global random preservation,
  assistant undo, redo, insertion before future History, and FCStd reopen. It
  emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_ARRAY_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true bounded_work=true rollback=true linear_1d=true
  linear_2d=true polar=true seeded_jitter=true global_random_preserved=true
  source_preserved=true replacement=true history=true marker=true receipt=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped
  human CAM atomicity, forced-failure rollback, and three CAM History replacement
  regressions pass; 177 focused provider contract tests pass; Manufacture
  inspection remains read-only across reopen; and the final-code protected GUI
  CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. Touched Python sources
  compile and pass Ruff, build staging is current, `FreeCADApp` builds, and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The Axis Map checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupAxisMap` to the dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/axis_map_dressup` replacement mutation with exact target
  type `ExactCamJobOperationAndAxisMapParameters`. Its closed contract accepts
  one exact Job and current base operation, one of the six shipped X/Y-to-A/B/C
  mappings, one positive bounded wrap radius in millimetres, and one explicit
  reverse-direction boolean. Preflight freezes the exact base, controller,
  coolant, path, Job group, History, selection, visibility, and every existing
  CAM path center; prepares the fully placed and arc-linearized path without
  mutation; rejects missing input-axis coordinates and output beyond 500,000
  commands; and refuses conflicting Axis Map radii because one Job owns one
  rotary center, returning the existing radius as repair data.
- Human and Native creation now share one caller-transaction factory, while the
  existing task command and edit workflow remain intact. A shared Native
  replacement lifecycle module centralizes exact target, source preservation,
  Job resource, History marker, presentation, and path postconditions for the
  remaining one-output CAM dress-ups instead of duplicating hundreds of lines
  per operation. The shipped remapping algorithm is now a task-free pure path
  function used by both human recompute and Native preflight.
- The live gate exposed and corrected the underlying rotary-center lifecycle:
  `ObjectJob.setCenterOfRotation` now writes Path values back rather than
  mutating discarded copies; standard operation generation and Array dress-up
  generation inherit the Job center in their own output paths; Axis Map and
  Array preserve it for suppressed/invalid paths; and a new human Axis Map in
  an existing consistent Job inherits its established radius. No Job execute
  pass mutates already-recomputed children, so operations do not remain touched.
  Axis Map still emits its own exact `Z=-radius` center, and paths outside the
  target Job remain unchanged.
- The compiled lifecycle gate exercises stale and zero-radius rejection,
  missing-axis refusal, conflicting-radius repair, forced rollback, all six
  mappings, reverse conversion, arc linearization, exact degree/feed
  conversion, Job-wide rotary-center propagation, outside-Job preservation,
  assistant undo, redo, insertion before future History, and FCStd reopen. It
  emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_AXIS_MAP_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true invalid_radius=true missing_axis=true
  radius_conflict=true rollback=true six_mappings=true reverse=true
  arc_linearization=true rotary_center=true outside_job_preserved=true
  source_preserved=true replacement=true history=true marker=true receipt=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The human
  Axis Map cancel/accept/default-center/one-undo lifecycle passes without
  touched operations; Array and Simple Copy lifecycles, CAM atomicity and
  rollback, three CAM History regressions, 177 focused provider contracts, and
  read-only Manufacture inspection all pass. The final-code protected GUI CAM
  VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration
  passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff, staging is current, and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The Path Boundary checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupPathBoundary` to the
  dedicated `manufacture.modify/path_boundary_dressup` replacement mutation
  with exact target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndPathBoundaryDefinition`. Its
  closed contract accepts one exact Job and exact current base operation plus
  one discriminated clipping solid: Job-model bounds with six explicit
  extensions, an explicit placed box, an explicit placed cylinder, or an exact
  current public solid. Inside/outside retention, boundary offset, retract
  threshold, and Rest Machining intent are all explicit; no selection or task
  dialog state is inferred.
- Preflight freezes the base, controller, coolant, Job group, model resources,
  reusable-solid source, History, selection, visibility, and full placed path.
  It builds the exact stock and clipped path without mutating the document,
  rejects empty cutting output, and bounds the work at 500,000 commands, 10,000
  boundary edges, 10,000 faces, 16 MiB of boundary BRep, and 5,000,000
  move-edge intersection units. Durable Stock and command streams retain exact
  fingerprints; transient OpenCASCADE offset/clone results use canonical
  topology, bounds, and geometric measurements because equivalent results can
  serialize with different internal BRep ordering.
- Human and Native creation share a task-free caller-owned factory while the
  existing interactive editor and public command remain intact. Every accepted
  result owns one real `Boundary` Stock resource immediately before the
  operation in History. Model-bound, box, and cylinder resources remain
  parametric; existing solids are preserved through a durable resource clone.
  The common dress-up lifecycle now handles optional owned-resource blocks and
  proves exact ownership, ordering, visibility, Job replacement, source
  preservation, and marker-aware History without changing the no-resource
  Array or Axis Map contract. Boundary output paths also inherit the Job rotary
  center at their own generation boundary.
- The compiled lifecycle gate exercises stale and invalid-definition rejection,
  empty-clip refusal, forced rollback, all four boundary definitions,
  inside/outside clipping, offset, retract threshold, Rest Machining state,
  owned Stock ordering, exact source preservation, assistant undo, redo, and
  FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_PATH_BOUNDARY_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true invalid_definition=true empty_clip=true
  rollback=true model_bounds=true box=true cylinder=true existing_solid=true
  inside_outside=true offset=true retract=true rest=true owned_stock=true
  source_preserved=true replacement=true history=true receipt=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped
  human Path Boundary cancel/accept/one-undo and owned-resource copy lifecycle
  pass. Array and Axis Map compiled lifecycles remain green; 144 focused
  provider/manifest/context/dispatch/state contracts pass; Manufacture
  inspection remains read-only across reopen; and the final-code protected GUI
  CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration
  passed`. Touched Python passes Ruff and compilation, release staging is
  current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Dogbone checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupDogbone` to the dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/dogbone_dressup` replacement mutation with exact target
  type `ExactCamJobOperationAndDogboneReliefDefinition`. Its closed contract
  accepts one exact Job and one exact current base operation; all five shipped
  Dogbone/T-bone styles; explicit left/right path side; discriminated adaptive,
  fixed-cutter-radius, or positive custom incision length; explicit outer
  closed-profile filtering; and zero through 256 exact placed-path XY corner
  groups to disable. A disabled location maps to every cutting-depth candidate
  at that XY position, matching the human checklist without exposing brittle
  raw candidate indices.
- Human recompute and Native preflight now share one task-free pure Dogbone
  generator, and human and Native creation share one caller-owned transaction
  factory while preserving the existing public `Create` function and task
  command. Preflight freezes the Job, exact base, controller, coolant, source
  path, History, selection, and visibility; derives the complete candidate
  catalog and final output before mutation; returns bounded actionable corner
  locations for an invalid disable target; and rejects empty reliefs, invalid
  tool diameter, more than 10,000 candidates, more than 2,048 XY groups,
  more than 500,000 result commands, pathological closed-profile searches, and
  excessive nested Dogbone duplicate work. Generated, inactive, and reopened
  paths retain the owning Job's rotary center.
- Postconditions prove the exact Dogbone proxy and view provider, base and Job,
  inherited controller and coolant, all authored relief settings, candidate
  grouping, blacklist, command stream, cutting count, rotary center, retained
  source, exact Job replacement, selection, visibility, and marker-aware
  History. The compiled gate exercises stale and invalid-custom rejection,
  wrong-side refusal, the bounded-work guard on a 2,000-command open profile,
  actionable corner repair, forced rollback, all five styles, both sides, all
  three incision modes, one XY disable across two cutting depths, outer-closed
  filtering, assistant undo, redo, insertion before future History, and FCStd
  reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_DOGBONE_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true invalid_custom=true wrong_side=true
  workload_guard=true actionable_locations=true rollback=true five_styles=true
  both_sides=true three_incisions=true grouped_disable=true closed_only=true
  source_preserved=true replacement=true history=true marker=true receipt=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`.
- The shipped human Dogbone cancel/accept/one-undo lifecycle and all 23 existing
  Dogbone algorithm/generator tests pass. Array, Axis Map, and Path Boundary
  compiled lifecycles remain green; 169 focused provider, manifest, context,
  dispatch, snapshot, state, undo, and dress-up factory contracts pass;
  Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and the final-code
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native
  API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff,
  release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Ramp Entry checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupRampEntry` to dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/ramp_entry_dressup` replacement mutation with exact
  target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndRampEntryDefinition`. Its closed contract
  uses four physically named strategies—forward then return, reverse into the
  cut, zigzag descent, and closed-contour helix—rather than GUI enumeration
  indices. The ramp angle is explicitly measured from vertical, and activation
  is either every eligible plunge or one absolute Job-coordinate Z threshold.
- The former 981-line GUI/algorithm mixture is split into a 311-line GUI
  factory/view/command boundary and a bounded headless generator shared by
  human recompute and Native preflight. Existing human-side proxy helper
  methods remain callable as delegates to the new core. The generator copies
  command parameter maps before feed assignment, owns all modal state per
  call, preserves Job rotary center, refuses zero-radius arcs and zero-length
  ramp loops, and no longer silently rewrites authored angle properties during
  recompute.
- Input, final output, intermediate generation, and candidate search are
  independently bounded at 50,000 commands, 500,000 commands, 1,000,000 work
  units, and 5,000,000 scan units. Tiny projections retain their plunge rather
  than deleting it, helix repetition is checked before allocation, and every
  generated motion is assigned an exact inherited horizontal, vertical, ramp,
  or rapid feed. Native creation refuses controllers with nonpositive required
  rates and returns the exact deficient property names.
- As with Mirror, Ramp Entry no longer edits the Job group from tree
  `claimChildren()`. Human and Native creation share one explicit
  `removeBefore=True` caller-owned replacement factory; the human command
  validates exact document name/ID, proxy/view provider, base and Job,
  provisional History enrollment, replacement metadata, group state,
  visibility, and output path before committing one undo step. Deletion from a
  different active document restores the exact retained base.
- The compiled Ramp Entry gate exercises stale and invalid-angle rejection,
  no-eligible-plunge refusal, exact missing-rate diagnostics, bounded-work
  refusal, forced rollback, all four shipped methods, real diagonal ramp
  motion, exact absolute-Z plunge splitting, source immutability, assistant
  undo/redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_RAMP_ENTRY_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true closed_schema=true invalid_angle=true
  no_effect=true machine_rates=true workload_guard=true rollback=true
  four_methods=true start_depth=true ramp_motion=true rotary_center=true
  source_preserved=true replacement=true history=true receipt=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped
  human creation, forced-validation rollback, and cross-tab deletion lifecycles
  pass; the preceding Mirror lifecycle remains green; 169 focused provider,
  manifest, registry, dispatch, snapshot, state, target, undo, and factory
  contracts pass; Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and
  the protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native
  API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff,
  release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Drag Knife checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupDragKnife` to the
  dedicated `manufacture.modify/drag_knife_dressup` replacement mutation with
  exact target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndDragKnifeCompensation`. Its closed
  contract accepts one exact Job and exact current base operation, a 0–180°
  corner filter, a positive physical blade-tip trailing offset up to 100 mm,
  and an explicit absolute pivot Z height up to 100 mm. The schema explains
  the physical meaning and limits of every field rather than exposing the
  historical property names.
- The old geometry engine has moved out of the GUI task module into a headless
  CAM core shared by human recompute and Native preflight. Generation now owns
  per-call modal position and result counters instead of the former
  process-global `currLocation`, while the long-standing GUI proxy class and
  direct-import module names remain available to human-side callers. The GUI
  module is now a thin restorable task/view layer, and both human and Native
  creation use one validated caller-owned transaction factory. The shared core
  also accepts valid arcs whose zero `I` or `J` component was omitted and
  rejects a truly zero-radius arc deterministically.
- Preflight freezes the Job, base, controller, coolant, placed path, History,
  selection, and visibility; computes the exact compensated stream before
  mutation; verifies the pivot height is above every compensated cutting
  depth; and rejects zero offset, no usable compensation, malformed arcs,
  more than 50,000 input commands, or more than 500,000 output commands.
  Postconditions prove the exact proxy/view provider, authored settings,
  candidate/action/depth counts, line and arc extension/twist counts, complete
  output path, Job rotary center, retained source, Job replacement, selection,
  visibility, and marker-aware History.
- The compiled lifecycle gate exercises stale and zero-offset rejection, the
  workload guard, unsafe pivot refusal with repair data, malformed zero-radius
  arc rejection, no-op refusal, forced rollback, line compensation, real arc
  extension and twist, corner filtering, assistant undo, redo, insertion
  before future History, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_DRAG_KNIFE_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true invalid_offset=true workload_guard=true
  unsafe_pivot=true malformed_arc=true no_op=true rollback=true line=true
  arc=true filter=true rotary_center=true source_preserved=true
  replacement=true history=true marker=true receipt=true selection=true
  visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`.
- The shipped human Drag Knife cancel/accept/one-undo lifecycle passes. The
  preceding Dogbone compiled lifecycle remains green; 169 focused provider,
  manifest, context, dispatch, snapshot, state, undo, and dress-up factory
  contracts pass; Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and
  the final-code protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript
  native API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass
  Ruff, release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Lead In/Out checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupLeadInOut` to dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/lead_in_out_dressup` replacement mutation with exact
  target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndLeadInOutMotionDefinition`. Each side is
  one closed discriminated request: disabled or one of all 13 shipped Arc,
  Line, Perpendicular, Tangent, 3D, Z, follow-profile, Helix, No Retract, and
  Vertical styles. Only parameters meaningful to that style are published,
  and every angle, radius/length, offset, extension, retract threshold, and
  rapid-plunge limit is visible in the provider schema.
- The 1,890-line GUI/algorithm mixture is split into a headless CAM generator
  and a thin serialized GUI proxy/task/view/command layer. Human recompute and
  Native preflight now share immutable `LeadDefinition` inputs and one bounded
  generator. Human recompute no longer silently rewrites authored radii or
  angles, disabling both leads returns the placed source immediately, and the
  human command refuses bases from which positive feeds and safe/clearance
  heights cannot be resolved. Its exact factory return is validated by
  document name/ID, proxy/view provider, base, Job, provisional History
  enrollment, replacement marker, and visibility before task ownership is
  accepted.
- Preflight freezes the exact Job, current operation, controller, coolant,
  source configuration/path, History, selection, and visibility; generates the
  complete output before mutation; rejects both sides disabled, invalid style
  payloads, unsafe feeds/heights, missing cutting profiles, no-effect output,
  more than 50,000 input commands, or more than 500,000 output commands; and
  returns concise profile/lead counts and path hashes. Closed-profile repeat
  work and follow-profile discretization are guarded before large allocation.
  Postconditions prove every authored setting, exact output, counts, Job rotary
  center, retained source, replacement, selection, visibility, and History.
- The audit also found that four dress-up helpers assigned Job center metadata
  through a live base `Path` alias during read-only preflight. Lead In/Out,
  Path Boundary, Dogbone, and Drag Knife now clone the path before changing
  center metadata. The Lead gate explicitly proves structural revision is
  unchanged for every one of its 26 style/side preflights, while all four
  compiled replacement lifecycles remain green.
- The compiled Lead In/Out gate exercises stale-target, closed-schema,
  invalid-angle, no-effect, workload, and forced-postcondition rollback paths;
  all 13 styles on both entry and exit; exact replacement; one-step assistant
  undo/redo; FCStd reopen; source preservation; selection/visibility stability;
  and rotary-center preservation. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_LEAD_IN_OUT_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true closed_schema=true invalid_angle=true
  no_effect=true workload_guard=true rollback=true thirteen_styles=true
  both_sides=true rotary_center=true source_preserved=true replacement=true
  history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. The shipped human cancel/accept/one-undo lifecycle passes; 169
  focused provider/manifest/registry/dispatch/state/factory contracts pass;
  Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and the protected
  GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker
  integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff, release staging
  is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Mirror checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupMirror` to dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/mirror_dressup` replacement mutation with exact target
  type `ExactCamJobOperationAndMirrorPlacementDefinition`. Its closed contract
  exposes only three meaningful placements: a selected global axis at the
  origin, that axis through the global-bounds center of one exact current Job
  model, or one exact axis-aligned `EdgeN`/`FaceN` reference. All three offset
  coordinates and retention of the unchanged placed base path are explicit;
  the historical `None` no-op is not published.
- Human recompute and Native preflight share one detached, bounded Mirror
  generator. It copies every command before transformation, preserves the Job
  rotary center, mirrors `I`/`J` arc centers and handedness correctly for X,
  Y, and XY, resolves model and reference geometry through transformed global
  shapes, and computes a true bounds-center reflection rather than combining
  local maxima with Placement translation. A hidden durable model link keeps
  Native center-based intent exact across recompute and FCStd reopen while old
  human documents retain their implicit Job-model behavior.
- The audit removed Mirror's reliance on the tree view provider to edit the
  CAM Job group from `claimChildren()`. Creation now performs an explicit
  caller-owned `removeBefore=True` Job replacement, while the view callback is
  read-only. The human command validates exact document name/ID, proxy/view
  provider, base and Job identity, provisional History enrollment,
  replacement metadata, group state, visibility, and generated path before
  committing its single undo step. Shared replacement errors now include the
  exact expected and actual Job operation names instead of only reporting a
  generic group mismatch.
- The compiled Mirror gate exercises stale auxiliary targets, closed schemas,
  diagonal-reference refusal, no-effect refusal, bounded-work rejection,
  forced rollback, all three axes, model-center and transformed-reference
  placement in global coordinates, XYZ offsets, retained base paths, arc
  handedness, source immutability, assistant undo/redo, and FCStd reopen. It
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_MIRROR_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true closed_schema=true invalid_reference=true
  no_effect=true workload_guard=true rollback=true three_axes=true
  model_center=true reference=true global_geometry=true offset=true
  keep_base=true arc_direction=true rotary_center=true source_preserved=true
  replacement=true history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped human creation, forced
  validation rollback, and cross-tab deletion-restoration lifecycles pass;
  the preceding Lead In/Out lifecycle remains green; 169 focused provider,
  manifest, registry, dispatch, snapshot, state, target, undo, and factory
  contracts pass; Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and
  the protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native
  API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff,
  release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Tag checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupTag` to dedicated
  `manufacture.modify/tag_dressup` replacement mutation with exact target type
  `ExactCamJobOperationAndHoldingTagDefinition`. Its closed contract contains
  only three complete physical placement requests: ordered explicit XY
  locations with durable enablement, deterministic minimum/maximum distribution
  over every bottom cutting wire, or exact copying of the shape and enabled
  locations from one frozen Tag dress-up. Material width, material height,
  side angle measured from horizontal, and top fillet radius are explicitly
  named, unit-bearing, and bounded; copy mode inherits those four authored
  values instead of accepting contradictory duplicates.
- A new 447-line task-free CAM generator now owns detached location safety
  evaluation and path construction while the existing public `Tag`,
  `PathData`, `ObjectTagDressup`, and human `Create` surfaces remain available.
  Human recompute and Native preflight share this generator. The CAM core no
  longer imports GUI preferences during ordinary generation, preserves the Job
  rotary center, samples trimmed curve parameters from their actual first
  parameter, and preserves a user's explicit disabled state instead of
  accidentally re-enabling every on-path disabled tag during recompute. The
  GUI adds one caller-owned `CreateInTransaction` boundary without opening the
  editor; the shipped task editor retains automatic generation, copy, manual
  add/edit/remove/clear, enable/disable, and atomic accept/cancel behavior.
- Native preflight freezes the exact Job, current base, controller, source Tag
  dress-up when copying, History, selection, visibility, source configuration,
  and command stream. It prepares the complete output before mutation; rejects
  nonpositive machine rates or tool diameter, malformed inherited disabled
  indices, empty/no-effect placements, enabled off-path/overlapping/start-point
  tags with indexed reason and XY repair data, more than 256 tags, more than
  5,000,000 edge/tag scans, or more than 500,000 output commands. Postconditions
  prove the exact shape, normalized positions, disabled indices, automatic
  counts, effective clipped heights/radii, mapped segments, path, rotary
  center, retained copy source, replacement, selection, visibility, and
  History state.
- The compiled Tag gate exercises stale and invalid-shape rejection, precise
  off-path diagnostics, bounded-work refusal, forced rollback, all three
  placement modes, durable disabled positions, source immutability, assistant
  undo/redo, and FCStd reopen. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_TAG_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true closed_schema=true invalid_shape=true
  off_path=true workload_guard=true rollback=true automatic=true explicit=true
  copy=true durable_disabled=true source_preserved=true rotary_center=true
  replacement=true history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The shipped human atomic editor,
  cross-document deletion restoration, and every-shipped-dress-up History
  lifecycle pass; the preceding Ramp Entry lifecycle remains green; 169 focused
  provider/manifest/registry/dispatch/snapshot/state/target/undo/factory
  contracts pass; Manufacture inspection remains read-only across reopen; and
  the protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native
  API/worker integration passed`. Touched sources compile and pass Ruff,
  release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Z Correct checkpoint maps shipped `CAM_DressupZCorrect` to dedicated
  background `manufacture.modify/z_correct_dressup` replacement mutation with
  exact target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndHumanAuthorizedProbeMap`. Its
  closed provider contract contains only the exact Job, current operation,
  label, maximum circular chord deflection, and maximum generated line-segment
  length. It accepts no path or file identity from the model: the host opens
  one human-controlled chooser for `.txt`, `.log`, `.probe`, or `.dat` input,
  grants one one-shot file authorization, and returns only a bounded basename,
  size, and SHA-256 summary.
- A new 458-line task-free CAM core now owns bounded UTF-8 probe parsing,
  complete rectangular-grid validation, detached B-spline construction,
  command freezing, and Z-corrected path generation. Human recompute and
  Native preparation use this same implementation. It preserves full-precision
  probe coordinates and the rotary center; uses ceiling-based line subdivision
  and chord-deflection-based circular subdivision; preserves detached non-cutting
  commands and feed values; and rejects duplicate/incomplete grids, nonfinite or
  oversized data, relative G91 paths, rotary cutting moves, unresolved motion,
  out-of-probe-area points, and bounded command overflows instead of silently
  returning or dropping motion.
- Native freezes the exact Job, base, controller, path, History, selection, and
  visibility before asking the human for input. File verification, strict parse,
  surface construction, and complete path generation run off the document
  thread with cooperative progress and cancellation. The document-thread
  commit uses the original frozen call ticket, performs one caller-owned exact
  Job replacement, and embeds the surface, content hash, grid dimensions,
  point count, and external basename. Native recompute is hash-pinned to that
  embedded surface and remains deterministic if the original file is later
  changed or removed; a human selecting a new file explicitly clears that
  pin. The view provider no longer mutates Job groups from `attach()`, and
  deletion restores the base through the dress-up's own document rather than
  whichever tab happens to be active.
- The compiled Z Correct gate exercises stale-target and closed-schema
  rejection before file selection, absence of any provider path field, human
  authorization, malformed and incomplete grids, out-of-bounds cutting paths,
  no-effect maps, bounded-work refusal, authorization-time file drift, real
  background execution, forced postcondition rollback, embedded/hash-pinned
  recompute after the source file is corrupted, source preservation, circular
  linearization, rotary-center preservation, exact replacement and History,
  receipt, selection, visibility, assistant undo/redo, and FCStd reopen. It
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_Z_CORRECT_DRESSUP_GUI_OK exact_job=true
  exact_base=true stale=true closed_schema=true human_authorization=true
  no_provider_path=true malformed_grid=true out_of_bounds=true no_effect=true
  workload_guard=true file_drift=true background=true rollback=true
  embedded=true hash_pinned=true source_preserved=true arc_linearization=true
  rotary_center=true replacement=true history=true receipt=true selection=true
  visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. Shipped human creation,
  History editing, undo, and cross-tab deletion restoration pass; the preceding
  Tag lifecycle remains green; 170 focused provider, manifest, registry,
  dispatch, snapshot, state, target, undo, background, and exact-factory
  contracts plus nine common-read contracts pass; Manufacture inspection
  remains read-only across reopen; and the protected GUI CAM VibeScript
  lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`.
  Touched sources compile and pass Ruff, release staging is current, and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The Comment checkpoint adds a real `Program` group to the human Manufacture
  ribbon and exposes only shipped `CAM_Comment` there while the remaining
  supplemental commands stay menu-only until their own rows are complete. The
  live action maps to dedicated `manufacture.program/comment` with exact target
  type `ExactCamJobAndProgramComment`. Its closed schema contains only a label,
  one exact Job `{object_name, expected_state_sha256}`, and one 1–1024 character
  comment; no generic G-code, command list, filesystem path, selection guess,
  or unrelated optional field is present. The concise success returns identity,
  bounded counts, path and state fingerprints, Job fingerprint, and the normal
  receipt without echoing the comment text.
- The human command and Native mutation now share one caller-transaction-owned
  `CreateInTransaction` factory that creates the exact `Path::FeaturePython`,
  Comment proxy, view provider, and Job membership. The existing human command
  still owns its transaction, recompute, validation, and History publication.
  Native strips surrounding whitespace and accepts printable ASCII only,
  excluding parentheses and every control/line-break character, so provider
  text cannot terminate the parenthetical comment or inject executable G-code.
  The original human API and behavior remain additive and intact.
- Native preflight freezes the exact Job hash, ordered operation group, complete
  document object identity, History identity/operations/visibility/suppression/
  marker, human selection, and existing visibility. It rejects stale Jobs,
  recompute or transaction overlap, unsafe text, and the bounded Job-operation
  limit before mutation. The owned transaction appends exactly one Job operation
  and inserts it at the exact History marker; postconditions prove the one-command
  path, proxy and Job ownership, source-preserving History state, unchanged prior
  History entries, unchanged selection/visibility, unrelated Job-resource
  invariants, and exact created/changed receipt identities.
- The compiled Comment gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_COMMENT_GUI_OK ribbon=true exact_job=true
  closed_schema=true stale=true injection_guard=true ascii_guard=true
  transaction_guard=true rollback=true text=true source_preserved=true job=true
  history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. The shipped human Comment/Stop atomic lifecycle and exact CAM
  menu/toolbar/composite graph pass; 196 focused provider, surface, manifest,
  registry, context, dispatch, snapshot, state, target, undo, background,
  session, common-read, and factory contracts pass; default and maximum live
  ribbon gates report Manufacture 56 and 62 respectively; Manufacture
  inspection remains read-only across reopen; and the protected GUI CAM
  VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration
  passed`. New modules pass Ruff, touched Python compiles, release staging is
  current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Stop checkpoint extends the real Manufacture `Program` group with shipped
  `CAM_Stop` and maps it to the second sharp `manufacture.program/stop` variant
  with exact target type `ExactCamJobAndProgramStop`. The closed variant accepts
  exactly a label, exact Job, and `stop_mode: optional | mandatory`; the schema
  states the machine semantics explicitly (`optional` emits M1 and depends on
  the optional-stop control, while `mandatory` emits M0). The full two-variant
  Program schema remains one closed discriminated object whose operation field
  publishes the exact per-variant field map; its shared label no longer expands
  into a redundant `anyOf`, and runtime rejects every cross-variant or extra
  field through exact argument sets.
- The proven Program Job/History boundary is now factored once in the 474-line
  `SteveCADNativeManufactureProgram.py`; Stop-specific mode mapping, creation,
  and command proof remain in a separate 158-line module. The human Stop command
  uses a new caller-owned `CreateInTransaction` factory while preserving its
  default Optional behavior and existing public command. Native maps only the
  two exact lower-case modes to the human enumeration and proves the durable
  property plus the single parameter-free M1 or M0 command; normal success
  returns the requested semantic mode, identities, bounded count, state/path
  fingerprints, Job fingerprint, and receipt without generic G-code payloads.
- The compiled Stop gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_STOP_GUI_OK ribbon=true exact_job=true
  closed_schema=true stale=true invalid_mode=true transaction_guard=true
  rollback=true optional=true mandatory=true source_preserved=true job=true
  history=true receipt=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. It creates both modes in revision-chained calls, proves two exact
  Job/History outputs, undoes only the second, redoes it, and reconstructs both
  proxies and commands after FCStd reopen. The refactored Comment lifecycle,
  shipped human Comment/Stop atomic lifecycle, and exact live CAM graph pass;
  196 focused provider/surface/manifest/registry/context/dispatch/snapshot/
  state/target/undo/background/session/common-read/factory contracts pass;
  default and maximum live ribbon gates report Manufacture 56 and 62 with 530
  and 541 unique visible IDs; Manufacture inspection remains read-only across
  reopen; and the protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript
  native API/worker integration passed`. New modules pass Ruff, touched Python
  compiles, release staging is current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Custom checkpoint adds shipped `CAM_Custom` to the real Manufacture
  `Program` group and maps it to `manufacture.program/custom` with exact target
  type `ExactCamJobControllerAndStructuredCustomProgram`. Its closed contract
  requires a requested safe label, one exact Job, one exact Job-owned tool
  controller, explicit `none | flood | mist` coolant, and 1–64 ordered blocks.
  Each block is either a 1–256-character non-executable printable-ASCII comment
  or one uppercase G/M code with 0–16 distinct, enumerated parameter words and
  finite numeric values. It exposes no raw G-code line, parser text, macro,
  variable, line number, source selector, or provider filesystem path.
- Native builds every command through `Path.Command(code, parameters)` instead
  of reparsing provider strings, freezes both Job and controller fingerprints,
  and uses the shared exact Program graph/History/selection/visibility boundary.
  Creation uses the human `PathCustom.ObjectCustom` and generic CAM task-editor
  view-provider types through a new caller-transaction factory; the existing
  human task panel still accepts raw text or a human-selected file. The
  operation retains source `Text`, an empty file field, exact structured stored
  lines, exact controller/coolant, and generated command order. Generic CAM's
  durable numeric label-uniqueness suffix is accepted only when it exactly
  extends the requested label; the actual emitted label is verified and
  returned.
- The compiled Custom gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_CUSTOM_GUI_OK ribbon=true exact_job=true
  exact_controller=true closed_schema=true no_raw_gcode=true
  no_provider_path=true stale=true injection_guard=true duplicate_guard=true
  transaction_guard=true rollback=true structured=true coolant=true
  source_preserved=true job=true history=true receipt=true low_noise=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. Comment and
  Stop remain green; the human menu/ribbon graph, human Custom/Probe task-panel
  lifecycle, and Comment/Stop transactions pass; 189 focused provider,
  manifest, registry, context, dispatch, state, target, undo, background,
  session, common-read, and factory contracts pass. Manufacture inspection is
  read-only across reopen, and the protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`.
- Default and maximum compiled surfaces now report Manufacture 57 and 63 with
  531 and 542 unique visible IDs; the classified union is Manufacture 64 and
  544 unique IDs. New modules and the lifecycle gate compile and pass Ruff,
  release staging is current, and full whitespace validation is clean.
- The Probe checkpoint adds shipped `CAM_Probe` to the real Manufacture
  `Program` group and maps it to the dedicated `manufacture.probe/create_grid`
  capability with exact target type
  `ExactCamJobProbeControllerAndBoundedStockGrid`. Its closed contract requires
  a G-code-safe label, exact Job, exact Job-owned probe Tool Controller, explicit
  X/Y point counts and calibration offsets, and absolute probe/safe/clearance Z
  values. Each axis is published as 3–64 points, the combined grid is explicitly
  documented and enforced at no more than 1024 points, probe depth must stay
  within the exact stock Z extent, safe height must be above the stock, and
  clearance must be at or above safe height. No provider file or output path is
  exposed; the durable operation stores an empty output name so the selected
  postprocessor performs its existing automatic probe-output naming.
- Native Probe uses the real `PathProbe.ObjectProbing` and generic CAM view
  provider, selects the exact controller through the shared caller-transaction
  factory, freezes the exact Job/controller/stock identities, and verifies every
  generated grid position, G38.2 feed move, retract, open/close annotation, and
  final clearance move. Probe commands are now recognized as valid cutting
  commands by the shared CAM generation diagnostics. The human Probe operation's
  X/Y calibration properties are corrected from unsigned `PropertyLength` to
  signed `PropertyDistance`, so negative physical offsets work in both the real
  task editor and Native creation. The shared Native CAM path-label contract now
  publishes and enforces printable ASCII without parentheses or control
  characters for machining, program, and dress-up operations that emit labels
  as G-code comments; ordinary Job and Tool labels remain unchanged. Command
  annotations need no parallel hash layer because CAM's canonical `toGCode()`
  already serializes them, and the compiled identity check proves that differing
  probe-open annotations produce differing path hashes.
- The compiled Probe gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_PROBE_GUI_OK ribbon=true exact_job=true
  exact_controller=true probe_tool=true closed_schema=true
  documented_limits=true no_provider_path=true stale=true
  injection_guard=true workload_guard=true motion_guard=true
  transaction_guard=true rollback=true automatic_output=true grid=true
  annotations=true annotation_identity=true diagnostics=true job=true
  history=true receipt=true human_editor=true signed_offsets=true
  low_noise=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true`. Comment, Stop, Custom, Mill Facing, and read-only Manufacture
  inspection remain green; 209 focused provider/input/output/surface/manifest/
  registry/context/dispatch/snapshot/state/target/undo/background/session/
  common-read/factory contracts pass; and the protected GUI CAM VibeScript
  lifecycle emits `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`.
  Default and maximum compiled surfaces report Manufacture 58 and 64 with 532
  and 543 unique visible IDs; the classified source union is Manufacture 65 and
  545 unique IDs. Touched Python compiles and passes Ruff, release staging is
  current, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Property Bag checkpoint promotes shipped `CAM_PropertyBag` from its
  previous menu-only location into the real Manufacture `Project Setup` group
  and maps it to the dedicated `manufacture.property_bag/create` capability
  with exact target type `ExactOptionalPartDesignBodyAndTypedPropertySet`.
  Native may create a root bag or attach it to the exact current
  `PartDesign::Body`; it accepts a bounded, closed, discriminated set of nine
  safe property kinds and canonicalizes their durable property order. The
  existing human task panel and shared `PathPropertyBagGui.CreateInTransaction`
  factory retain the real proxy/view-provider behavior and human-only
  `App::PropertyFile`, while no provider schema or result exposes a file/path
  field. Snapshot state includes bag identity, destination Body, property
  names, groups, and kinds but never property values, descriptions, file paths,
  or internal path hashes.
- The compiled Property Bag gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_PROPERTY_BAG_GUI_OK ribbon=true
  exact_body=true root=true closed_schema=true typed_values=true
  schema_budget=true no_provider_path=true human_file=true snapshot=true
  stale=true duplicate_guard=true reserved_guard=true transaction_guard=true
  rollback=true history=true receipt=true low_noise=true selection=true
  visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`. The real CAM human task
  panel, exact live menu/toolbar/composite graph, exhaustive shipped-command
  timeline, and caller-transaction refusal tests pass in the compiled GUI. All
  169 focused manifest/registry/surface/context/dispatch/snapshot/state/target/
  undo contracts pass; touched Python compiles and passes Ruff; release staging
  and whitespace validation are clean. Probe remains green, and the protected
  GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. Default and maximum
  compiled surfaces report Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533 and 544 unique
  visible IDs; the classified source union is Manufacture 66 and 546 unique
  IDs.
- The Area checkpoint maps the two experimental human actions `CAM_Area` and
  `CAM_Area_Workplane` to one focused `manufacture.area` capability with the
  explicit `create`, `create_view`, and `set_workplane` variants. Area creation
  accepts one through 64 exact whole-shape, Face, or Edge targets, creates the
  real parametric CAM subshape resources for subelements, and publishes one
  canonical resource-first History block. Area View targets one exact current
  `Path::FeatureArea`; Workplane targets one exact Area plus a whole 2D shape,
  Face, or containing wire selected by Edge. Preflight freezes the complete
  document/History/selection/visibility boundary and exact BRep identities;
  results remain bounded to identities, topology counts, workplane linkage,
  History position, and receipts rather than returning geometry payloads.
- Area View is now an explicit replacement operation in both the human C++
  command and Native execution. The implementation preserves the captured
  source presentation until strict semantic publication validates the complete
  dependency graph, then lets the declared replacement transition hide only
  the source Area. Workplane assignment similarly proves that only the target
  Area's authored workplane properties and accepted History visibility change.
  The compiled lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_AREA_GUI_OK ribbon=true closed_schema=true
  create=true subshape_resource=true view=true workplane=true
  exact_targets=true stale=true duplicate_guard=true transaction_guard=true
  rollback=true history=true receipt=true low_noise=true snapshot=true
  selection=true visibility=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true`.
- The real human `CAM_Area` Area View replacement and existing Area/Workplane
  History tests pass in the compiled GUI, including exact undo/redo restoration.
  A broader 181-test Native manifest/registry/surface/context/dispatch/snapshot/
  state/target/undo suite passes; touched Python compiles and passes Ruff, and
  full whitespace validation is clean. Probe remains green and the protected
  GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. Default and maximum
  compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533 and 544 unique IDs;
  the classified source union remains Manufacture 66 and 546 unique IDs.
- The Start Point checkpoint maps human-selected context action
  `CAM_SetStartPoint` to the focused `manufacture.operation/set_start_point`
  variant with exact target type `ExactCamJobOperationAndPlanarStartPoint`.
  Its closed provider request contains only the exact Job, exact current
  operation, and planar `x_mm`/`y_mm`; provider-controlled Z is impossible and
  the implementation derives Z from the operation's frozen Clearance Height,
  exactly matching the human Snapper command. Operation state and Manufacture
  snapshots now publish the enabled flag, exact three-dimensional point, and
  clearance height as bounded semantic state. Preflight freezes Job ownership,
  the exact `App::PropertyVectorDistance`/boolean/distance property contract,
  complete document graph, History, selection, visibility, operation group,
  and unrelated-operation states. Mutation is one in-place transaction with
  exact-target recompute, no-change refusal, fail-closed rollback, and a
  canonical Job-plus-operation receipt.
- The Start Point verifier distinguishes authored configuration from legitimate
  regenerated CAM output: hidden `AreaParams`, `PathParams`, and
  `removalshape` are classified as derived generation state while every other
  non-target authored property remains exact. Postcondition failures name the
  precise configuration properties that drifted. The compiled gate uses a real
  generated Profile rather than a synthetic path object, proves that its
  toolpath hash changes after applying the new start point, and emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_START_POINT_GUI_OK context=true
  closed_schema=true planar_input=true derived_z=true snapshot=true
  real_profile=true property_contract=true regenerated_path=true
  exact_job=true exact_operation=true stale=true transaction_guard=true
  rollback=true duplicate_guard=true no_change=true receipt=true
  low_noise=true history=true selection=true visibility=true undo=true
  redo=true reopen=true`.
- Both real human Start Point lifecycle tests pass with the true distance-vector
  contract, including callback document binding, one undo entry, cancellation,
  rollback, undo/redo, and FCStd restoration. Profile, Area/Workplane, and
  operation-active compiled neighbor gates remain green; 193 focused Native
  manifest/background/capability/common-read/context/dispatch/registry/session/
  snapshot/state/surface/target/undo contracts pass. Touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff, release staging and whitespace validation are clean, and the
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle emits
  `CAM VibeScript native API/worker integration passed`. Default and maximum
  compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533 and 544 unique IDs.
- The GL simulation checkpoint maps human action `CAM_SimulatorGL` to the focused
  `manufacture.simulation/gl` view capability. Its closed request contains one
  exact current Job, one through 64 distinct exact active operations in their
  current Job order, and quality 1 through 10. It is classified as background
  presentation, never as a document mutation; the retired native simulator is
  intentionally reserved for the separate result-producing checkpoint.
  Main-thread preflight validates the Job graph, generated paths, Job-owned tool
  controllers, ToolBit shapes, stock, model resources, complete exact-target
  hashes, command bounds, and the frozen structural revision. The detached
  worker copies placement and shape inputs, applies operation placement to each
  path, builds tool profiles through the same geometry helper as the human
  simulator, serializes bounded G-code, and hashes the exact prepared program.
- The compiled CAM simulator now has an additive prepared-mesh boundary:
  `PrepareShapeMesh` releases the Python GIL while OCC tessellates detached
  shapes, while `BeginPreparedSimulation`, `SetPreparedBaseShape`, and
  `AddGCode` reject non-GUI-thread presentation. The opaque internal mesh format
  validates its magic, version, exact byte count, finite vertices, index range,
  triangle count, 65,536-vertex ceiling, and four-million-index ceiling before
  OpenGL receives it. Existing human simulator entry points remain unchanged.
  Closing the Native task releases its retained simulation and removes only its
  Native-owned MDI view, restoring the exact prior window set and active view.
- A real generated Profile Job passes the compiled lifecycle gate and emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_GL_SIMULATION_GUI_OK context=true
  closed_schema=true exact_job=true ordered_operations=true active_path=true
  quality=true background=true gui_responsive=true compiled_mesh=true
  detached_tools=true placed_gcode=true cancel=true stale=true
  document_close=true ribbon_switch=true duplicate_guard=true task_owned=true
  status_during_task=true low_noise=true history=true undo_neutral=true
  selection=true visibility=true revision_neutral=true view_teardown=true`.
  The gate proves immediate return, a responsive Qt heartbeat during held worker
  preparation, worker/main-thread separation, cooperative cancellation before
  presentation, revision-stale rejection, document-close rejection, frozen
  ribbon invalidation, duplicate-call replay, status polling during the owned
  task, exact task teardown, and no object, History, undo, selection, visibility,
  or structural-revision change. The human simulator shape-copy regression and
  the neighboring Profile, operation-active, and Start Point compiled gates pass.
  Two hundred thirteen focused Native manifest/background/capability/common-read/
  context/dispatch/registry/session/snapshot/state/surface/target/undo contracts
  pass; default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with
  533 and 544 unique IDs. The protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle passes
  unchanged, touched Python compiles and passes Ruff, release targets build, and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The retained material-result checkpoint maps human action `CAM_Simulator` to
  the separate `manufacture.simulation_result/native` mutation capability; it is
  not an alias or variant of the read-only GL presenter. Its closed request
  contains one exact current Job, one through 64 distinct exact active generated
  operations in current Job order, and the same quality 1-through-10 scale as
  the human simulator. Main-thread preflight rejects open transactions and
  recompute, validates current-History usability, Job-owned controllers and
  ToolBit shapes, stock solidity, exact Job/operation hashes, command support,
  command/grid bounds, and the exact object graph and History marker. Only
  copied shapes, placements, and immutable command values cross to the worker.
- The native `PathSimulator.PathSim` boundary now releases the Python GIL around
  stock initialization, ToolBit sampling, every voxel command, tessellation,
  mesh merging, and height-field statistics. The additive
  `GetCombinedResultMesh` entry point returns the same complete outer-plus-inner
  material mesh retained by the human simulator without merging it on the GUI
  thread. Cancellation and bounded progress are checked between commands and
  operations. Commit revalidates the frozen structural revision, exact sources,
  graph, and History, then creates one visible `Mesh::FeaturePython`
  `CutMaterial` in one Native-owned transaction. Durable read-only provenance
  records the exact Job name, ordered operation names, quality, derived
  resolution, and placed-program SHA-256 without adding dependency links or
  changing the Job operation group.
- A real generated eight-pass Profile Job passes the compiled lifecycle gate and
  emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_SIMULATION_RESULT_GUI_OK context=true
  closed_schema=true exact_job=true ordered_operations=true quality=true
  background=true gui_responsive=true native_gil_release=true cancel=true
  stale=true document_close=true ribbon_switch=true duplicate_guard=true
  durable_mesh=true provenance=true history=true receipt=true undo=true redo=true
  reopen=true selection=true visibility=true low_noise=true`. The gate proves
  immediate scheduling, actual Qt heartbeat progress during native voxel work,
  worker/main-thread separation, cooperative cancellation before commit,
  revision-stale rejection, document-close rejection, frozen-ribbon rejection,
  duplicate-call replay, a concise status/result contract, one exact History
  insertion and undo entry, exact undo/redo, and FCStd restoration. Human
  simulator cancel, accept/retain, validation rollback, and ToolBit shape-copy
  regressions pass; the GL lifecycle gate remains green; 193 focused Native
  contracts pass; default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59
  and 65 with 533 and 544 unique command IDs; and the protected CAM VibeScript
  API/worker integration passes unchanged. Touched Python compiles and passes
  Ruff, `PathSimulator` and `SteveCADScripts` build, and whitespace validation is
  clean.
- The optional CAMotics checkpoint maps human action `CAM_Camotics` to the
  focused `manufacture.camotics/camotics` presentation capability only when the
  live Manufacture ribbon contains that action. Its closed request contains one
  exact current Job, one through 64 distinct exact active operations in their
  direct current Job order, and a fully discriminated `read_result` or `launch`
  request with explicit low, medium, or high resolution. No provider path,
  executable, process command, output filename, or selection fallback exists.
  Main-thread preflight validates the optional Python API, fixed installed
  executable identity for launch, Job/operation/controller/tool/stock graph,
  generated commands, current-History usability, complete object and
  presentation state, and the frozen structural revision before any detached
  work starts.
- Only bounded immutable commands, placements, tool facts, stock bounds, and
  exact-state evidence cross to the CAMotics worker. The worker produces a
  metric absolute program with explicit tool changes under a one-million-command
  and 128-MiB incremental bound, runs the published asynchronous CAMotics API,
  supports cooperative cancellation, and validates at most two million path
  steps plus an exact finite binary STL of at most 256 MiB and five million
  facets. `read_result` returns only duration, step/facet counts, bounds, and
  program/surface digests. `launch` writes a private host-owned G-code/project
  pair, invokes only the revalidated frozen installed executable without a
  shell, reaps it, and deletes the private workspace after exit. Neither branch
  mutates the document, History, undo/redo state, structural revision,
  selection, visibility, or GUI modified state.
- A real generated Profile Job and a faithful implementation of the published
  optional Python API pass the compiled lifecycle gate, which also launches an
  actual fixed audit executable. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_CAMOTICS_GUI_OK optional_unavailable=true
  optional_available=true closed_schema=true no_provider_path=true
  exact_job=true ordered_operations=true resolution=true background=true
  gui_responsive=true cancel=true selection_stale=true revision_stale=true
  document_close=true ribbon_switch=true duplicate_guard=true
  bounded_result=true fixed_executable=true private_project=true
  process_reaped=true workspace_cleanup=true document_unchanged=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true selection=true visibility=true
  low_noise=true`. One hundred nineteen focused CAMotics/manifest/registry/
  surface/dispatch/background contracts pass. Default and maximum compiled
  surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533 and 544 unique visible IDs,
  while the optional compiled gate proves the 66-action CAMotics surface. The
  protected GUI CAM VibeScript lifecycle passes unchanged, `SteveCADScripts`
  builds, source and release staging match, touched Python compiles and passes
  Ruff, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The complete-job postprocessing checkpoint maps human action `CAM_Post` to
  the single `manufacture.post/complete_job` variant. Its closed request accepts
  only an exact current Job name and state hash; the provider cannot choose the
  processor, processor source, executable, command line, machine file, output
  path, filename, or post options. Main-thread preflight validates the current
  History and complete direct Job operation set, bounds active generated input
  to 64 operations and one million commands, freezes the human-configured
  machine and processor identities, saves a private document snapshot, and
  proves that snapshotting did not change the live document.
- A fixed authenticated child opens only that private snapshot under
  `FreeCADCmd`, restores the exact Job, executes the authenticated bytes of the
  configured modern processor, disables remote posting, and rejects legacy
  wrapper processors before launch. The worker is cancellable and bounded to
  ten minutes, 2 GiB of memory, 64 output files, 256 MiB per file, and 1 GiB in
  total. Main-thread finalization revalidates the exact ribbon, document,
  structural revision, Job, History, processor, child, executable, selection,
  visibility, transaction, undo, and redo state. Every proposed output requires
  a separate one-shot human destination grant, and the additive output-bundle
  publisher commits split files as one all-or-rollback set while preserving all
  prior destination contents on cancellation, collision, or failure.
- A real Job using the installed LinuxCNC modern processor passes the compiled
  lifecycle gate and emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_POST_GUI_OK
  closed_schema=true no_provider_processor=true exact_job=true
  configured_machine=true isolated_freecadcmd=true background=true
  gui_responsive=true cancel=true human_authorized=true output_cancel=true
  atomic_output=true split_output=true duplicate_destination=true
  selection_stale=true revision_stale=true processor_stale=true
  document_close=true ribbon_switch=true legacy_rejected=true
  remote_disabled=true duplicate_guard=true workspace_cleanup=true
  bounded_result=true document_unchanged=true history=true undo=true redo=true
  selection=true visibility=true low_noise=true`. One hundred forty-eight
  focused Native post/output/manifest/background/registry/surface contracts
  pass. Default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with
  533 and 544 unique visible IDs. The protected CAM VibeScript API/worker gate
  passes unchanged; source and release staging match; touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff; release targets build; and whitespace validation is clean.
- The selected-operation checkpoint adds the second and final
  `manufacture.post/selected_operations` variant for human action
  `CAM_PostSelected`; `manufacture.post` is consequently no longer an
  incomplete provider family. Its closed operation contract requires the same
  exact Job plus one through 64 distinct exact active direct operations in
  current Job order. The provider still cannot supply processor, source,
  executable, command, options, filename, or destination. Host preflight
  resolves every exact operation against its bounded turn-start state, rejects
  duplicates, inactive or non-Job entries, reordered targets, unavailable
  History inputs, empty paths, and programs above one million commands.
- The shared authenticated snapshot/worker/publication pipeline now carries an
  explicit complete-Job or selected-operations mode. The fixed child restores
  and revalidates every selected name and state in current Job order, initializes
  the postprocessor against the real Job and then installs only the authenticated
  operation subset, and returns the exact variant and selected count for host
  authentication. Machine discovery therefore remains correct, while the
  output contains only the requested subset. Final results return the ordered
  posted operation names and hashes without paths or command payloads; all
  cancellation, stale-state, processor-identity, human-authorization, atomic
  multi-output, and document/UI invariants from complete-Job posting remain
  shared rather than duplicated.
- The compiled lifecycle gate posts a real two-operation Profile Job both ways
  and proves that the exact one-operation program is materially smaller than
  and byte-distinct from the complete program. It rejects reversed target order
  before launch and emits `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_POST_GUI_OK
  closed_schema=true no_provider_processor=true exact_job=true
  selected_operations=true exact_operation_order=true configured_machine=true
  isolated_freecadcmd=true background=true gui_responsive=true cancel=true
  human_authorized=true output_cancel=true atomic_output=true split_output=true
  duplicate_destination=true selection_stale=true revision_stale=true
  processor_stale=true document_close=true ribbon_switch=true
  legacy_rejected=true remote_disabled=true duplicate_guard=true
  workspace_cleanup=true bounded_result=true document_unchanged=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true selection=true visibility=true
  low_noise=true`. One hundred forty-nine focused Native contracts pass;
  default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533
  and 544 unique IDs; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes;
  source and release staging match; touched code compiles and passes Ruff; and
  whitespace validation is clean.
- The template-export checkpoint maps human action `CAM_ExportTemplate` to the
  single `manufacture.template/export_template` variant with an exact current
  Job target and every content choice from the human dialog: explicit bounded
  description, optional configured postprocessing, zero through 32 exact direct
  tool controllers, discriminated stock exclusion or exact extent/placement,
  rapid/coolant/height/depth SetupSheet groups, and zero through 64 exact
  currently supported per-operation setting names. The closed request contains
  no path, destination, filename, processor, or arbitrary property payload.
  Runtime resolves all exact identities against the frozen turn-start state,
  validates current SetupSheet support, serializes canonical version-1 JSON
  under a 16-MiB bound, and publishes it only through one human-authorized
  atomic `.json` output grant. Results contain only content counts and hashes,
  the authorized artifact basename/size/hash, and explicit unchanged-state
  evidence.
- Human and Native export now share the additive authoritative
  `ObjectJob.exportTemplateAttributes` serializer rather than maintaining
  parallel encoders. The existing human command retains its public entry point
  and dialog behavior and delegates its accepted choices to that serializer.
  Real round-trip testing also exposed and corrected the shared importer's
  processor-enumeration check: a processor is now restored only when it is an
  exact offered enumeration, instead of incorrectly testing substring
  membership in the current processor string. The compiled gate invokes the
  actual human command and requires its bytes to equal Native output, imports
  those bytes into a second real CAM Job, and proves restoration of description,
  processor, tools, stock, and SetupSheet content.
- The lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_TEMPLATE_GUI_OK context=true
  complete_family=true closed_schema=true no_provider_path=true exact_job=true
  exact_controllers=true human_authorized=true canonical_human_format=true
  round_trip=true cancel=true stale=true duplicate_guard=true
  document_unchanged=true history=true undo=true redo=true selection=true
  visibility=true low_noise=true`. It additionally proves human cancellation
  preserves prior output, selection drift rejects before overwrite, duplicate
  replay is refused, authorization runs on the main thread, paths never enter
  provider results, invalid SetupSheet names return bounded repair values, and
  source document, History, undo/redo, selection, visibility, revision, and GUI
  modified state remain unchanged. One hundred forty-one focused contracts
  pass; default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with
  533 and 544 unique IDs; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle
  passes unchanged; source and release staging match; touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff; and whitespace validation is clean.
- The Manufacture Robot checkpoint reuses the exact shared Robot capability
  implementations intentionally established by rows 11.38 and 11.39 instead
  of duplicating CAM-specific mutation code. Human actions `Robot_Edge2Trac`,
  `Robot_TrajectoryDressUp`, and `Robot_TrajectoryCompound` resolve on the
  Manufacture ribbon to the closed `robot.trajectory` variants `edge2_trac`,
  `trajectory_dress_up`, and `trajectory_compound`; `Robot_Simulate` resolves
  to the closed preview-only `robot.motion/simulate` variant. The live
  Manufacture snapshot supplies the same bounded exact Robot, tool-shape, and
  trajectory identities and digests used by Assemble. No variant exposes GUI
  selection or preselection, workbench switching, command dispatch, paths, or
  document lifecycle authority.
- Current compiled lifecycle gates now resolve both capability families against
  the actual Manufacture provider surface and prove that neither is missing,
  unimplemented, nor incomplete there. All three trajectory variants dispatch
  under a frozen human-selected Manufacture ribbon with exact current targets
  and verified transaction-free no-op results; their real mutations retain the
  existing human-command parity, exact History, stale/cycle rejection,
  rollback, idempotency, undo/redo, reopen, and selection guarantees. The
  simulation variant also dispatches under the frozen Manufacture ribbon and
  must return byte-for-byte-equivalent bounded samples to the shared human-
  equivalent preview while leaving document revision, undo, and durable Robot
  state unchanged. The gates emit
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_TRAJECTORY_FEATURES_GUI_OK human_edge_parity=true
  human_dress_up_parity=true human_compound_parity=true exact_history=true
  exact_targets=true manufacture_surface=true stale_noop=true cycle_noop=true
  bounded=true rollback=true verified_noop=true idempotent=true undo_redo=true
  reopen=true selection_preserved=true` and
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_MOTION_GUI_OK human_set_home_parity=true
  human_restore_home_parity=true human_simulation_parity=true
  exact_targets=true stale_noop=true rollback=true verified_noop=true
  idempotent=true undo_redo=true preview_only=true manufacture_surface=true
  reopen=true selection_preserved=true`.
- Seventy-three focused Robot/manifest/context/registry contracts pass. The
  protected Robot VibeScript lifecycle also now has the same ordinary GUI
  scheduling boundary as the CAM gate; this corrects a test-harness defect in
  which FreeCAD loaded the script under a host-specific module name and silently
  left an empty GUI open without ever calling `main()`. Its full real lifecycle
  completes with `"integration": "robot_vibescript_api", "ok": true` and all
  canonical API, stable output, worker validation, rollback, save/reopen,
  reference-guard, and isolated-context flags true. No VibeScript production
  API changed. Test staging matches the release tree, touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff, and whitespace validation is clean.
- The KUKA compact checkpoint maps human action `Robot_ExportKukaCompact` to
  the focused `robot.export/export_kuka_compact` variant on Manufacture. Its
  closed request accepts only one exact Robot, one exact non-empty trajectory,
  and the frozen global/per-object Robot and trajectory digests already present
  in Manufacture state. There is no provider path, filename, destination,
  selection, preselection, command, workbench, timestamp, or arbitrary KRL
  payload. Preflight rejects open transactions, recompute, stale or absent
  identities, invalid/suppressed targets, a trajectory unavailable at the
  current History position, zero waypoints, and any trajectory above the
  existing 4,096-waypoint bound.
- `KukaExporter` now exposes additive in-memory `ProgramName`,
  `RenderCompactSub`, and `RenderFullSub` boundaries. The existing public human
  `ExportCompactSub` and `ExportFullSub` entry points, file-dialog commands, and
  output formats remain present and delegate to those shared renderers. This
  eliminates separate human/Native KRL encoders while preserving the public
  API and existing path behavior. Native freezes the host-generated timestamp,
  renders and re-renders exact bytes under an 8-MiB bound, and guards the full
  Robot/trajectory state, document objects and object states, optional History,
  selection, visibility, undo/redo, transaction, GUI-modified state, ribbon,
  document, and structural revision before atomically replacing one separately
  human-authorized `.src` destination. The result returns only exact target
  hashes, waypoint count, KRL program name/format/hash, artifact basename,
  size/hash/replacement state, and unchanged flags; it never returns a path or
  KRL body.
- A real two-waypoint Robot trajectory passes the compiled gate, whose Native
  output must be byte-for-byte equal to the actual shipped human command under
  the same frozen timestamp. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_KUKA_EXPORT_GUI_OK compact=true human_parity=true
  closed_schema=true no_provider_path=true exact_robot=true
  exact_trajectory=true nonempty=true bounded=true human_authorized=true
  atomic=true cancel=true stale_target=true selection_stale=true
  duplicate_guard=true main_thread=true document_unchanged=true history=true
  undo=true redo=true selection=true visibility=true low_noise=true`. The gate
  additionally proves provider-path rejection before authorization, stale
  target rejection before the file dialog, one-shot main-thread authorization,
  cancellation and post-authorization selection drift preserving the existing
  destination, and call-ID replay without a second prompt. One hundred focused
  export/registry/manifest/context/dispatch/surface contracts pass. The shipped
  Robot human compact/full export lifecycle remains green. The protected Robot
  VibeScript lifecycle completes with `"ok": true` and every detailed flag
  true; no VibeScript production source changed. RobotScripts and
  SteveCADScripts build, source/release staging matches, touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff, whitespace validation is clean, and the split production
  modules remain below 1,000 lines.
- The KUKA full checkpoint adds the second and final closed `robot.export`
  variant, `export_kuka_full`, for human action `Robot_ExportKukaFull`. It uses
  the same exact Robot, exact non-empty trajectory, and frozen global/per-object
  state digests as compact export. The provider still cannot supply either
  destination, filename, timestamp, selection, command, or KRL content. Host
  preflight renders the authoritative source/data pair through the shared
  additive `KukaExporter.RenderFullSub` boundary, freezes the generated
  timestamp, enforces the existing 4,096-waypoint and 8-MiB-per-file bounds,
  and verifies the pair a second time against unchanged Robot, trajectory,
  document, History, selection, visibility, undo/redo, transaction, GUI, ribbon,
  active-document, and structural-revision state.
- Full export requests two separate main-thread human grants, one `.src` and
  one `.dat`, and publishes the already validated pair through the general
  Native output-bundle boundary. The bundle consumes every grant before
  generation, refuses duplicate destinations, stages every file privately,
  preserves prior destinations as private siblings during replacement, and
  restores the complete prior set if any publication step fails. No partial
  new KUKA program is intentionally retained. The bounded result contains only
  exact target hashes, waypoint count, program name/format, source/data hashes,
  authorized artifact basenames/sizes/hashes/replacement flags, and explicit
  unchanged-state flags; it contains neither filesystem paths nor generated
  KRL bodies.
- The compiled lifecycle gate invokes both actual shipped human export commands
  and requires Native compact and full bytes to match them exactly under the
  same timestamp. It emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_ROBOT_KUKA_EXPORT_GUI_OK compact=true full=true
  complete_family=true human_parity=true closed_schema=true
  no_provider_path=true exact_robot=true exact_trajectory=true nonempty=true
  bounded=true human_authorized=true atomic=true atomic_bundle=true
  rollback=true cancel=true stale_target=true selection_stale=true
  duplicate_guard=true main_thread=true document_unchanged=true history=true
  undo=true redo=true selection=true visibility=true low_noise=true`. The gate
  also proves second-grant cancellation preserves prior output, an injected
  second-publication failure restores both original files, and duplicate call
  replay cannot reopen authorization. One hundred twelve focused
  export/output/registry/manifest/context/dispatch/surface contracts pass. The
  shipped human compact/full test remains green; the protected Robot VibeScript
  lifecycle completes with `"ok": true` and every detailed flag true; default
  and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533 and 544
  unique visible IDs; source/release staging matches; touched Python compiles
  and passes Ruff; the legacy exporter's CRLF convention is preserved; and
  CRLF-aware whitespace validation is clean.
- The Manufacture readiness checkpoint now carries the already-frozen
  turn-start human selection into the Manufacture domain snapshot. A directly
  selected Job, one of its owned Job/tool/operation/stock resources, or a
  public model uniquely used by that Job selects it; otherwise only a sole
  current Job is unambiguous. Multiple Jobs without a distinguishing human
  selection return `active_job: null` with `choose_job`, while a cross-Job
  selection returns `ambiguous_selection`. Native assistance therefore cannot
  choose the manufacturing context on the human's behalf. Direct headless
  snapshot callers with no Jobs remain GUI-independent.
- The new bounded `active_job` block returns the exact Job identity/hash,
  stock presence/solid validity/bounds, configured machine state, up to 32
  compact ordered controller/ToolBit identities, and up to 64 compact ordered
  operation identities. Every operation includes its zero-based Job position,
  active state, command count, exact state hash when readable, controller, and
  explicit `toolpath_valid`/issue state. Aggregate validity reports the complete
  active-operation and command counts, invalid and uninspected counts, and
  whether all active paths are usable. Existing full/paged Job and tool readers
  remain present for detailed edits; the turn-start block does not duplicate
  editable property payloads or command bodies.
- Simulation readiness checks the bounded active-operation set, current History
  usability, nonempty valid toolpaths, one-million-command limit, solid stock,
  valid model resources, and each active operation's exact Job-owned controller
  and ToolBit shape/number/diameter. Post readiness shares the same operation
  facts and resolves the configured machine, processor, and output convention
  through the exact production post configuration boundary; it additionally
  verifies that the processor exists and is a supported modern class-based
  processor. Both return bounded repair issues and
  `exact_preflight_required: true`: readiness is useful routing evidence, not a
  false claim that workflow-specific freezing has already executed. No path,
  processor source, output pattern, command stream, or mutable host object is
  exposed.
- The compiled read/context lifecycle gate emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_MANUFACTURE_INSPECT_GUI_OK job_state=true sanity=true
  toolpath_paging=true loop=true active_job=true human_selection=true stock=true
  machine=true tools=true ordered_operations=true toolpath_validity=true
  simulation_readiness=true post_readiness=true low_noise=true
  invalid_toolpath_reason=true stale_rejection=true read_only=true reopen=true`.
  It proves the complete top-level turn-start snapshot stays below its existing
  bound, positive readiness for a real generated Job, exact failure after the
  active path is emptied, and no document, History, selection, undo, or revision
  changes from reads. Focused selection tests prove sole, selected, ambiguous,
  and choose-Job resolution. One hundred thirty-two focused Native contracts
  plus the targeted headless Robot/snapshot regression pass. The existing real
  isolated post gate remains green after extracting its shared configuration
  reader; the protected CAM VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes unchanged;
  default and maximum compiled surfaces remain Manufacture 59 and 65 with 533
  and 544 unique visible IDs; source/release staging matches; touched modules
  remain below 1,000 lines; and Ruff, Python compilation, and whitespace
  validation are clean.
- The final Manufacture responsiveness audit preserves the intended lifecycle
  split instead of moving document objects onto worker threads. Job creation,
  tool creation/editing, and representative toolpath creation remain bounded,
  task-panel-free document-thread commits under the common atomic transaction
  runner. Their compiled Job, Tool, and Profile gates prove exact targets,
  rollback, one-step undo/redo, and save/reopen. Work that can be long-running
  is detached before its document or presentation commit: Z Correct probe-map
  preparation, GL simulation, durable native simulation, CAMotics, complete-Job
  postprocessing, and selected-operation postprocessing all require the shared
  background lifecycle. An explicit manifest invariant now prevents any of
  those six actions from silently losing `background_required`; it also keeps
  document-neutral CAMotics/GL work classified as background presentation,
  durable simulation and Z Correct as background mutation, and postprocessing
  as background output.
- The compiled Z Correct, GL simulation, durable simulation, CAMotics, and post
  gates all report `background=true`. The GL, durable simulation, CAMotics, and
  post gates run real 10-ms Qt heartbeat timers across controlled worker work
  and report `gui_responsive=true`; durable native evaluation additionally
  proves `native_gil_release=true`. They exercise cooperative cancellation,
  duplicate rejection, stale-target/revision rejection, document close and
  ribbon-switch teardown where applicable, bounded status/results, exact
  commit ownership, and document-neutral presentation/output behavior. The
  post gate covers both complete-Job and selected-operation variants and also
  proves human-authorized atomic output. The focused action-manifest contract
  has 48 passing tests and its touched source passes Ruff and whitespace
  validation. This is the direct UI-responsiveness evidence for CAM simulation
  and postprocessing rather than an inference from successful output alone.

### 15. Implement the Drawing surface

- The first Drawing checkpoint registers one sharp `drawing.page` family with
  only the three live Page actions. Default creation uses TechDraw's configured
  template with the shipped default as fallback. Custom creation is a one-shot
  human-authorized SVG input: the provider supplies and receives no filesystem
  location, the bounded content is validated before mutation, and a changed
  file is refused before publication. Template-field edits target one exact
  page state and require every field's observed value, rejecting stale pages,
  stale values, duplicates, unknown fields, no-ops, and unsupported content.
- Page and template publication is one resource-first History block under the
  common atomic mutation runner. Exact postconditions cover embedded-template
  content, fields, graph ownership, and created-object boundaries while
  preserving selection and visibility. The compiled lifecycle gate reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_PAGE_GUI_OK default=true human_parity=true
  custom=true human_authorized=true path_private=true exact_fields=true
  active_page=true closed_schema=true cancel=true file_drift=true stale=true
  rollback=true selection=true visibility=true history=true undo=true
  redo=true reopen=true low_noise=true`. It compares Native default creation
  with the actual shipped human command, exercises custom creation and exact
  editing through the frozen Drawing turn, and proves rollback, one-step
  undo/redo, save/reopen, and concise selected-page context.
- One hundred ninety-three focused registry, manifest, schema, dispatch,
  snapshot, state, output, undo, and surface contracts pass. Default and
  maximum compiled ribbon gates remain green with Drawing 107 and 112 actions
  and 533 and 544 unique visible IDs. The complete protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker publication, reconfiguration, rollback, deletion, and
  save/reopen lifecycle passes against its current shared VibeScript surface;
  no VibeScript production module was changed. Source/release staging matches,
  every new Drawing module remains below 1,000 lines, and Python compilation,
  Ruff, and whitespace validation are clean.
- Standard projected-view creation now freezes one exact page, an ordered set
  of exact whole-object sources, a deterministic standard orientation,
  placement, scale policy, and line policy. High-quality TechDraw HLR runs in
  a bounded cancellable FreeCADCmd worker with a private configuration and
  authenticated B-rep protocol; the document thread reauthorizes the frozen
  turn and exact revision/page/source states, then adopts TechDraw's persistent
  precomputed projection in one atomic History operation. The provider receives
  only a concise job receipt followed by bounded `native.job` progress or the
  verified page/view result, and no filesystem location or camera ambiguity.
- The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_STANDARD_VIEW_GUI_OK exact_page=true
  exact_sources=true selected_sources=true closed_schema=true
  deterministic_orientation=true placement=true scale=true line_style=true
  projected_geometry=true no_task=true stale_page=true stale_source=true
  duplicate_guard=true rollback=true cancel=true selection=true visibility=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true responsive=true path_private=true
  low_noise=true`. It exercises the real worker, main-thread adoption, injected
  postcondition rollback, cancellation, a live Qt heartbeat, one-step undo/redo,
  and save/reopen. Cache adoption clears the exact view's touched state so the
  GUI does not launch a redundant asynchronous HLR job afterward. Focused
  Drawing, background, registry, action-manifest, and default/maximum surface
  contracts pass, source/release staging is exact, and the protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker lifecycle remains green without a production VibeScript
  change.
- Page redraw is now the closed `drawing.page/redraw_page` operation for the
  real `TechDraw_RedrawPage` action. It targets one exact page and its complete
  active view graph, freezes source shapes and authored view state on the
  document thread, then redraws projections, dimensions, and dependent views
  in dependency order inside a private authenticated FreeCADCmd snapshot.
  TechDraw page-view proxies are canonicalized through stable document object
  identity before subtype APIs are used. The worker evaluates the exact frozen
  dimension references without silently applying interactive reference repair;
  valid descriptive geometry remains transferable even when TechDraw retains a
  reference-continuity warning, and a later native recompute invalidates stale
  persisted dimension cache state.
- Redraw commits only derived display caches and therefore preserves the human
  undo stack instead of manufacturing a misleading model-edit transaction. The
  cache savepoint restores projections, dimensions, selection, visibility,
  History, and `KeepUpdated` after cancellation, stale state, or failed
  postconditions. The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_REDRAW_GUI_OK exact_page=true exact_graph=true
  exact_sources=true closed_schema=true background=true detached=true
  authenticated=true projection=true dimension=true rollback=true cancel=true
  stale_preflight=true stale_commit=true selection=true visibility=true
  history=true keep_updated=true undo_stack_preserved=true reopen=true
  responsive=true path_private=true low_noise=true`. The gate changes both a
  projected edge and a real linked dimension, proves rollback and save/reopen,
  and verifies that the provider receives no snapshot or filesystem path.
  One hundred five focused Drawing, mutation, background, registry, manifest,
  and context contracts pass; the pre-existing page and standard-view compiled
  gates remain green; `TechDraw VibeScript native API/worker integration
  passed`; source/release staging is exact; all redraw modules remain below
  1,000 lines; the touched TechDraw/SteveCAD boundary compiles and is clean under
  Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation. No VibeScript
  production module changed.
- Broken-view creation is now the second closed `drawing.view` variant. It
  freezes one exact page, an ordered set of exact whole-object sources, one to
  sixteen exact break definitions, deterministic orientation, placement,
  scale, line policy, and break gap. A break is either one straight edge or one
  two-line parallel Sketcher object; source and break identities must be
  disjoint and remain exact through commit. The authenticated background
  worker opens a private full-document snapshot, preserves Sketcher identity,
  creates a real `TechDraw::DrawBrokenView`, compares it with a same-setting
  control projection, and returns only the verified projection cache and
  bounded semantic break summaries. The document thread reauthorizes every
  frozen state before adopting that cache into one atomic History operation.
- The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_BROKEN_VIEW_GUI_OK exact_page=true
  exact_sources=true exact_breaks=true sketch_identity=true single_edge=true
  context_hash=true closed_schema=true background=true authenticated=true
  native_type=true orientation=true placement=true scale=true line_style=true
  gap=true broken_geometry=true no_task=true stale_page=true stale_break=true
  duplicate_guard=true disjoint_guard=true orientation_guard=true
  rollback=true cancel=true stale_commit=true selection=true visibility=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true responsive=true
  path_private=true low_noise=true`. The gate uses both supported break forms
  simultaneously and proves the real undo/redo/save/reopen lifecycle. It also
  exposed and corrected an OCC boundary defect where a valid projected edge
  wrapped in a wire or compound was cast directly to `TopoDS_Edge`; the native
  projection path now extracts exactly one edge and rejects zero or multiple
  edges explicitly, eliminating the GUI exception and restored-document
  invalid geometry.
- One hundred twenty-one focused Drawing, registry, manifest, dispatch, and
  context contracts pass. Page, standard-view, and redraw compiled regressions
  remain green, as does the complete protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker
  lifecycle. Source/release staging is exact, all new broken-view modules are
  below 1,000 lines, and the touched boundary is clean under native build,
  Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation.
- Active View is a separate single-operation `drawing.active_view` capability,
  keeping raster viewport capture out of the vector-projection schema. It
  freezes one exact page and the human's exact turn-start 3D viewport state,
  including camera, visual object presentation, selection, TechDraw raster
  resolution, and visible geometry. The closed request supplies placement,
  scale, either the human command's fixed full frame or one bounded physical
  crop, and a transparent, current-viewport, or solid RGB background. Capture
  runs on the GUI thread required by Coin, embeds the bounded PNG through
  `TechDraw::DrawViewImage`, records durable content and viewport hashes, and
  returns only concise image metadata—never the internal image location or
  encoded pixels. When a Drawing page is active it resolves the sole open 3D
  viewport like the shipped human command; multiple non-active 3D viewports are
  refused as ambiguous instead of silently choosing one.
- The compiled lifecycle first exercises `TechDraw_ActiveView` itself as the
  parity oracle for provisional task rollback, image type, embedding, and its
  1280 by 1024 full frame. It then reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_ACTIVE_VIEW_GUI_OK human_parity=true
  exact_page=true exact_viewport=true context_hash=true closed_schema=true
  main_thread=true native_type=true png=true embedded=true placement=true
  scale=true crop=true background=true size_bound=true stale_viewport=true
  stale_page=true rollback=true selection=true visibility=true history=true
  undo=true redo=true reopen=true path_private=true low_noise=true
  no_task=true`. The test changes the real camera to prove stale-state refusal,
  injects a failed verifier to prove atomic cleanup, inspects the embedded PNG
  pixels and dimensions, and proves one-step undo/redo plus save/reopen.
- One hundred twenty-four focused Drawing/registry/manifest contracts and
  twenty-nine provider/session/surface contracts pass. Page, standard-view,
  broken-view, and redraw compiled gates remain green, as does the protected
  TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle. Source/release staging is exact,
  every active-view module remains below 1,000 lines, and Python compilation,
  Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Section View is a separate single-operation `drawing.section_view`
  capability for one exact Drawing page, one exact base view, the base view's
  exact active sources, one section origin, one in-plane viewing direction,
  and one explicit scale policy. The host derives the section plane,
  projection frame, rotation, placement, and line presentation instead of
  asking the provider to reproduce TechDraw internals. Source extraction and
  OCC section/projection work run in an isolated worker; the document thread
  adopts bounded, validated projection and cut-surface caches in one
  transaction. Section-derived views defer painting their projection cache
  until the cut-surface cache is also current, so Qt never observes a
  half-initialized section. Persisted source-state signatures cover only the
  relevant History prefix, allowing a downstream section operation without
  falsely invalidating its upstream base view while still detecting marker,
  suppression, or ordering changes at and before that base.
- The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_SECTION_VIEW_GUI_OK exact_page=true
  exact_base=true exact_sources=true context_hash=true closed_schema=true
  derived_plane=true deterministic_placement=true custom_scale=true
  line_style=true native_type=true cut_geometry=true no_task=true
  stale_page=true stale_base=true stale_source=true zero_direction_guard=true
  rollback=true cancel=true stale_commit=true selection=true visibility=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true responsive=true
  path_private=true low_noise=true`. It exercises the shipped default SVG
  hatch path, an injected verifier failure, cancellation, mid-flight source
  drift, UI heartbeat responsiveness, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd reopen.
  The 78 focused Drawing/registry/manifest contracts pass; page, redraw,
  standard-view, broken-view, and active-view compiled lifecycles remain green;
  the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle passes against the
  rebuilt binaries; and the touched boundary is clean under native build,
  Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation.
- Complex Section View is a separate single-operation
  `drawing.complex_section` capability for one exact Drawing page, one exact
  base view, the base view's exact active sources, and one exact complete Edge
  or Wire profile. Its closed request exposes only the human command's three
  real projection strategies (`offset`, `aligned`, and `no_parallel`), one
  placement point, and one explicit scale policy. The host derives section
  planes and projection frames; the isolated worker authenticates the
  projection, raw cut pieces, section faces, and prepared aligned-section
  shape independently before the document thread adopts all bounded caches in
  one transaction. Closed profiles are accepted only by the offset strategy,
  matching the native geometry that can represent them honestly.
- The TechDraw implementation now performs aligned-piece construction inside
  the existing section background job instead of starting a nested future over
  mutable view state. This preserves the public alignment-waiting contract,
  eliminates the headless completion race, and keeps the GUI responsive. Its
  restored presentation derives segment directions from a bounded profile
  prism instead of transient recompute-only shape size, so cached aligned and
  offset views paint correctly after adoption, undo/redo, and document reopen.
- The rebuilt compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_COMPLEX_SECTION_GUI_OK exact_page=true
  exact_base=true exact_profile=true exact_sources=true context_hash=true
  closed_schema=true derived_plane=true strategies=3
  deterministic_placement=true custom_scale=true native_type=true
  cut_geometry=true prepared_geometry=true no_task=true stale_page=true
  stale_profile=true rollback=true cancel=true stale_commit=true
  selection=true visibility=true history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true
  responsive=true path_private=true low_noise=true`. All 183 focused Drawing,
  registry, manifest, background, dispatch, session, state, snapshot, and
  output contracts pass. The protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker gate
  exits successfully against the rebuilt binaries, and the touched boundary is
  clean under Python compilation, Ruff, scoped whitespace validation, and the
  native `TechDraw`, `TechDrawGui`, and `SteveCADScripts` build targets.
- Detail View is a separate single-operation `drawing.detail_view` capability
  for one exact page, one exact projected base view and its active sources,
  one base-local anchor and radius, one page placement, and one explicit scale
  policy. The closed schema does not expose projection axes, source copying,
  clipping solids, or the global matting preference; the host freezes and
  revalidates those human-owned values. It also does not invent an independent
  label field: TechDraw durably derives `Detail <reference>` from the human
  command's reference field, which keeps undo/redo semantics exact.
- Detail clipping and HLR execute in an isolated `FreeCADCmd --safe-mode`
  process. The result protocol authenticates the exact FCStd snapshot,
  projected edges/faces and clipped detail shape independently, bounds their
  bytes and topology, and adopts both durable caches in one document-thread
  transaction. TechDraw now exposes an additive typed detail-cache API,
  restores that cache lazily and after undo/redo or FCStd reopen, and no longer
  launches a second asynchronous detail cut after completing the synchronous
  headless path.
- The compiled lifecycle first exercises `TechDraw_DetailView` itself as the
  parity oracle, including its provisional object graph and task rollback. It
  then reports `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_DETAIL_VIEW_GUI_OK human_parity=true
  exact_page=true exact_base=true exact_sources=true context_hash=true
  closed_schema=true anchor=true radius=true deterministic_placement=true
  custom_scale=true native_type=true clipped_geometry=true no_task=true
  stale_page=true stale_base=true stale_source=true radius_guard=true
  rollback=true cancel=true stale_commit=true selection=true visibility=true
  history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true responsive=true
  path_private=true low_noise=true`. All 183 focused Drawing, registry,
  manifest, background, dispatch, session, state, snapshot, and output
  contracts pass; the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker gate exits
  successfully against the rebuilt binaries; every new module remains below
  1,000 lines; and native build, Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped
  whitespace validation are clean.
- Draft-source View is a separate single-operation
  `drawing.draft_source_view` capability for one exact Drawing page, one exact
  same-document Draft source graph, one deterministic orientation, one page
  placement, one page/custom scale policy, and either source-owned styling or
  one complete style override. The closed provider schema exposes no SVG,
  filesystem path, Python proxy, or mutable document object. Its concise
  result reports only stable identities, exact source state, placement,
  scale/style, and bounded SVG byte/hash metadata.
- The host fingerprints every persistent application and presentation
  property on the source and its bounded outward dependency graph. Part shape
  properties use their canonical persisted BREP instead of FreeCAD's
  restore-rebuilt element-name map, so an unchanged source retains the same
  semantic state across FCStd reopen without weakening stale-source detection.
  Rendering runs in a private authenticated snapshot through an isolated
  offscreen `FreeCADCmd --safe-mode` child; both child and host reject
  declarations, active content, external resources, oversized artifacts, and
  SVG without drawable geometry before the document thread can publish it.
- TechDraw now exposes an additive typed Draft-cache API. The native runtime
  adopts the authenticated SVG and exact source-state token rather than
  regenerating Draft geometry on the UI thread. The hidden cache survives
  transaction rollback, one-step undo/redo, and FCStd reopen, remains active
  through the complete restore recompute boundary, and invalidates after a
  real source/dependency or render-setting edit. The existing human
  `TechDraw_DraftView` command and ordinary uncached Draft behavior remain
  unchanged.
- The rebuilt compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_DRAFT_VIEW_GUI_OK human_parity=true exact_page=true
  exact_source=true source_presentation=true context_hash=true
  closed_schema=true orientation=true placement=true custom_scale=true
  style=true native_type=true svg_geometry=true no_task=true stale_page=true
  stale_source=true rollback=true cancel=true stale_commit=true
  selection=true visibility=true history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true
  responsive=true authenticated=true offscreen=true path_private=true
  low_noise=true cache_invalidation=true`. All 199 focused Drawing, registry,
  manifest, background, dispatch, session, state, snapshot, output, and
  surface contracts pass. The protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker
  lifecycle passes against the rebuilt binaries; every new module remains
  below 1,000 lines; and the `TechDraw`, `TechDrawGui`, and `SteveCADScripts`
  build targets, Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation
  are clean.
- Clipping is now one closed `drawing.clip_group` family. The real ribbon
  action creates one useful nonempty group from an exact page, complete frame
  state, deterministic page placement, and one to forty-eight exact existing
  views with explicit clip-local placement. Three explicitly declared
  supplemental operations add exact ungrouped views, remove exact members
  with mandatory page-exit placement, or configure the complete label,
  position, frame visibility, and child-clipping state. Supplemental variants
  are a first-class registry contract rather than fabricated ribbon/context
  inventory, so the provider receives the sharp supporting operations without
  falsely claiming that SteveCAD ships extra human commands.
- Clip state hashes the exact page, frame, ordered membership, each member's
  local coordinates, exclusive group ownership, validity, and current History
  usability. The runtime refuses stale pages/groups/members, duplicates,
  nested clips, projection-group items, cross-page membership, multiple clip
  ownership, inactive History targets, and selections too large to preserve
  exactly. Entry and exit coordinates are required because TechDraw converts
  a member to clip-local coordinates on add and does not restore page
  coordinates on remove. The transaction runner now has additive post-
  recompute and post-abort presentation stabilizers: deferred tree reparenting
  can preserve the human selection on success and after rollback without
  weakening postconditions or recomputing the whole document.
- `TechDraw::DrawViewClip` now identifies its `Views` as structural History
  children, matching `DrawPage` semantics. A later view can therefore join an
  earlier clip group without manufacturing a reverse design dependency,
  reordering semantic History, or creating a DAG cycle. The existing human
  create/add/remove commands and `ViewProviderViewClip::claimChildren()` tree
  behavior remain unchanged. The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_CLIP_GROUP_GUI_OK human_create=true human_add=true
  human_remove=true exact_page=true closed_schema=true exact_group=true
  exact_members=true local_entry=true page_exit=true complete_frame=true
  clip_children=true nested_guard=true projection_group_guard=true
  duplicate_guard=true exclusive_membership=true stale_page=true
  stale_member=true structural_history=true tree_children=true rollback=true
  selection=true visibility=true history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true
  path_private=true low_noise=true no_task=true`. It exercises the actual
  human commands, injected Native create/configure rollback, a member created
  later in History, exact tree children, one-step undo/redo, concise selected
  context, and FCStd reopen. Two hundred fifty-seven focused Drawing,
  registry, mutation, dispatch, state, session, snapshot, output, undo, and
  surface contracts pass. The protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker gate
  reports success against the rebuilt binaries; all new modules remain below
  1,000 lines; and native build, source/release staging, Python compilation,
  Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Drawing stacking is one closed `drawing.stack` family covering the four
  shipped human actions: top, bottom, up, and down. Every request names one
  exact page and one to thirty-two unique, ordered exact views. Targets must
  remain valid and History-usable on that page, retain their inspected stack
  hashes, and be available in an open page scene. Multiple targets are applied
  sequentially in request order, matching the human command semantics; later
  top or bottom targets therefore finish beyond earlier targets. Cross-page,
  duplicate, stale, unavailable, invalid, and signed stack-order exhaustion
  cases are refused before a retained mutation.
- TechDrawGui now exposes additive typed access to the existing
  `ViewProviderDrawingView` stacking primitives and their real graphical
  sibling scope. That scope is the page for ordinary views and the graphical
  owner for clip-owned views, so Native neither simulates selection nor
  invents a second stacking model. The shared host implementation now also
  refuses signed integer overflow and safely ignores non-Drawing page children
  instead of casting them unsafely. Native freezes every Drawing stack order,
  persistent view placement/style field, page membership, History, selection,
  and visibility; postconditions prove that only the requested `StackOrder`
  values changed, and rollback restores the complete savepoint.
- The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_STACK_GUI_OK human_top=true human_bottom=true
  human_up=true human_down=true shared_host_primitive=true exact_page=true
  ordered_targets=true page_scope=true owner_scope=true stale_target=true
  stale_page=true cross_page_guard=true rollback=true selection=true
  visibility=true history=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true
  closed_schema=true path_private=true low_noise=true no_task=true`. It runs
  all four real human commands, page and clip-owner scopes, ordered multi-view
  calls, injected verifier failure, one-step undo/redo, selected-stack context,
  and FCStd save/reopen. The existing clip-group GUI regression remains green;
  183 broader action, registry, context, dispatch, output, session, state,
  snapshot, and undo contracts pass; and the protected TechDraw VibeScript
  API/worker lifecycle reports success against the rebuilt binaries. Source
  and release staging is byte-identical, all six new files remain below 1,000
  lines, and native build, Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace
  validation are clean.
- Explicit projected dimensions are one closed `drawing.dimension` family
  with eight discriminated operation branches: aligned Length, Horizontal,
  Vertical, Radius, Diameter, two-edge Angle, ordered three-point Angle, and
  Area. Every request freezes one exact page, view, projection hash, and each
  zero-based `EdgeN`, `VertexN`, or `FaceN` element hash; label position uses
  conventional +Y-up view coordinates. Radius and Diameter refuse elliptical
  or circle-like approximate geometry unless the request explicitly accepts
  it, while unsupported radial and angular selections return bounded repair
  guidance from TechDraw's real validators.
- Human and Native dimension creation now share one compiled
  `DimensionBuilder`; the existing human commands retain their own selection,
  transaction, and presentation wrappers. The projected-geometry boundary is
  additive: the existing `getProjectedElementDescriptors()` shape and +Y-down
  convention remain unchanged for VibeScript, while Native uses the new exact
  Edge/Vertex/Face descriptor API in +Y-up coordinates. Hidden read-only
  `PrecomputedDimension*` cache refreshes no longer advance authored structural
  revision, and transient `DocumentObject.State` remains visible diagnostically
  without destabilizing exact hashes across undo/redo or reopen.

  The projected-geometry lifecycle separately proves conventional +Y-up
  coordinates and legacy API compatibility. One hundred sixty-nine focused
  registry, manifest, schema, state, dispatch, output, session, and Drawing
  contracts pass. The protected gate reports `TechDraw VibeScript native
  API/worker integration passed`; no VibeScript production module changed.
  All new modules remain below 1,000 lines, source/release staging is exact,
  and native build, Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation
  are clean.
- Horizontal and Vertical Extent are now explicit branches of the same closed
  `drawing.dimension` family. Each request chooses a discriminated
  `{scope: "whole_view"}` target or a bounded one-to-sixty-four exact EdgeN
  target with frozen projection and element hashes; an empty edge array is
  never overloaded to mean the whole view. Both operations use the real
  `DrawDimHelper::makeExtentDim` path shared by the human commands and create
  `TechDraw::DrawViewDimExtent`, not simulated endpoint dimensions or
  persistent cosmetic geometry. State reports direction, exact target scope,
  measured result, page/view ownership, History usability, and durable hash.
- The Drawing snapshot now recognizes extent `Source` as a LinkSubList target
  descriptor instead of treating it as an ordinary projected-view source
  list. Selected/page context therefore reports exact extent state without
  trying to serialize the descriptor as a document object. The rebuilt live
  gate reports `operations=create_length,create_horizontal,create_vertical,
  create_radius,create_diameter,create_angle,create_three_point_angle,
  create_area,create_horizontal_extent,create_vertical_extent`, together with
  `human_extent_oracle=true whole_view_extent=true edge_subset_extent=true
  invalid_extent_repair=true`. It proves both real human commands, both Native
  target scopes, mixed-edge refusal with repair guidance, exact rollback and
  revision behavior, one-step undo/redo, context snapshot, and FCStd reopen.
  One hundred eighty-five broader registry, manifest, dispatch, state,
  snapshot, output, session, target, and undo contracts pass; the protected
  TechDraw VibeScript API/worker gate remains green; the compiled targets,
  Ruff, Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Axonometric Length is the eleventh closed `drawing.dimension` branch. Its
  measurement is explicitly either one exact projected edge or an ordered
  exact vertex pair with a separate direction edge; a second exact edge
  defines extension orientation. Every referenced element is projection- and
  hash-pinned, the two directions must be distinct and nonparallel, label
  placement remains conventional +Y-up, and the caller must echo the observed
  `projected`, `x_axis_true_length`, `y_axis_true_length`, or
  `z_axis_true_length` mode. Stale classification is refused before mutation.
- The human and Native paths now share a 280-line TechDraw axonometric helper
  over the compiled `DimensionBuilder`. It replaces the old temporary-wire
  coordinate-vector calculation—which collapsed and raised `IndexError` for
  orthographic projection directions—with direct orthonormal projection math,
  without changing the legacy utility API. The human command retains its
  transaction, selection, automatic midpoint, Dimension3D label, and parallel-
  direction no-op. Native adds explicit placement, inference refusal, exact
  angles, projected/displayed values, persisted arbitrary-format state, and
  History verification. Straight projected edges now report their observable
  `axonometric_value_mode`, so the model does not reverse-engineer it.
- The rebuilt lifecycle reports `human_axonometric_oracle=true
  axonometric_value_mode=true axonometric_edge=true
  axonometric_vertex_pair=true` alongside all ten prior dimension/extent
  markers. It proves the real human command, both Native measurement forms,
  stale-mode refusal, exact selection/visibility/History and revision
  preservation, rollback, one-step undo/redo, snapshot, and FCStd reopen.
  One hundred eighty-five broader contracts and the protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker lifecycle pass. All touched/new modules remain below
  1,000 lines, source/release staging is byte-exact, and build, Ruff, Python
  compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Horizontal and Vertical Chamfer are two closed branches of the focused
  `drawing.special_dimension` family rather than additions to the already
  bounded general-dimension module. Each request names one exact page and
  view, freezes the view and projection hashes, supplies two distinct ordered
  `VertexN` references with their element hashes, and gives an explicit +Y-up
  label position. The result reports the exact direction, size, order-sensitive
  angle, formatted size-and-angle text, page/view ownership, History usability,
  and durable state hash without returning the projected geometry inventory.
- Both shipped human Chamfer commands and Native use the same compiled
  `DimensionBuilder` validation and constructor. The human commands retain
  selection-driven placement, their transaction and warning behavior, ordered
  angle semantics, selection clearing, and repaint. Native adds stale-target
  refusal, bounded repair data, transaction enrollment, exact postconditions,
  selection and visibility preservation, rollback, and one-step undo/redo.
  The Drawing snapshot recognizes the durable chamfer format and returns the
  same exact state in selected and page context after save/reopen.

  dimension lifecycle remains green, 165 broader manifest, registry, schema,
  state, dispatch, and snapshot contracts pass, and the protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker gate reports success. Source/release staging is
  byte-identical, all new modules remain below 1,000 lines, and compiled build,
  Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Arc Length is the third closed `drawing.special_dimension` branch. Each
  request freezes one exact page, view, projection hash, open circular
  `ArcOfCircle EdgeN`, element hash, label, and explicit +Y-up label position.
  Host validation reports the real unscaled arc length before mutation; the
  durable result retains that source edge and length, concise format state,
  page/view ownership, History usability, and a stable state hash without
  returning the projected geometry inventory.
- The shipped human Arc Length command and Native now use the same compiled
  `DimensionBuilder` constructor. That constructor replaces the legacy pair of
  cosmetic endpoint vertices—which survived human undo because TechDraw
  cosmetic output properties are not transaction-restored—with one direct
  projected-edge reference. `DrawViewDimension` derives the extension points
  from the open circular arc while hidden output properties retain its source
  and true length. The source projection is therefore unchanged by creation,
  human undo/redo, Native verifier rollback, and save/reopen.
- The rebuilt lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_SPECIAL_DIMENSION_GUI_OK
  operations=create_horizontal_chamfer,create_vertical_chamfer,create_arc_length

  The complete neighboring Drawing-dimension lifecycle remains green, 143
  broader manifest, registry, schema, state, dispatch, and snapshot contracts
  pass, and the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle reports
  success. Source/release staging is byte-identical, all focused modules remain
  below 1,000 lines, and compiled build, Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped
  whitespace validation are clean.
- Balloon creation is one closed `drawing.balloon` operation. A request freezes
  one exact page, projected view, projection hash, and hash-pinned `EdgeN` or
  `VertexN`; supplies explicit Unicode text and label; and places the bubble by
  a bounded +Y-up offset in the same scaled view coordinates reported by
  projected-geometry inspection. The concise result returns the durable anchor,
  element hash, view-space placement, text, human-default style, page/view
  ownership, History usability, validity, and stable state hash without
  returning the projection inventory. Explicit Native text does not consume the
  page's human auto-number sequence.
- The shipped human command and Native use one compiled `BalloonBuilder`.
  Selected human edges resolve to their midpoint and selected vertices to their
  point through the same host validator as Native, including rotated/scaled
  views; interactive human placement remains available. `DrawViewBalloon`
  persists its exact `AnchorSource`, so identity survives undo/redo and FCStd
  reopen. The view tree now deduplicates children reached through multiple link
  properties, preventing the persisted source and anchor links from producing
  duplicate Balloon nodes.
- Balloon editing adds three supplemental closed branches to the existing
  `drawing.balloon` family rather than overloading creation: `set_text` accepts
  only an exact Balloon and replacement text; `set_style` accepts only an exact
  Balloon and all nine human-editable style fields; and `move_bubble` accepts
  only an exact Balloon and a view-space offset. Each target pins the current
  durable Balloon state hash. The published style enumerates every host bubble
  and leader-end value and closes RGB, scale, kink, font-size, line-width, and
  line-visibility structures, so the provider sees no optional-field bag or
  unknown type.
- `SteveCADNativeDrawingBalloonEdit.py` keeps the edit path separate from the
  compiled creation builder. It refuses stale, invalid, unavailable, malformed,
  and no-op requests before opening a transaction. Its verifier proves exact
  requested text/style/placement, unchanged identity, anchor, page membership,
  History, source projection, auto-number sequence, human selection, and object
  visibility. Host `Touched`/`Up-to-date` messages remain diagnostic rather than
  durable identity, while validity and timeline usability remain mandatory.
  Native editing never opens the human task dialog; the existing double-click
  TaskBalloon editor remains human-controlled and retains its command-owned
  transaction behavior.

  lifecycle reports success. Source/release staging is byte-identical, every
  new file remains below 1,000 lines, and compiled build, Python compilation,
  Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Dimension Repair is a dedicated `drawing.dimension_repair` capability with
  one `repair_references` operation rather than an edit bag on dimension
  creation. Its replacement is a closed discriminated union for all fourteen
  shipped semantic kinds: Length, Horizontal, Vertical, Radius, Diameter,
  Angle, three-point Angle, Area, horizontal/vertical Extent,
  horizontal/vertical Chamfer, Arc Length, and Axonometric Length. Every call
  freezes the exact existing dimension repair-state hash, page, projected view,
  projection hash, and replacement-element hashes. Repair preserves the
  dimension's identity, semantic kind, label position, formatting/style,
  tolerance configuration, page membership, History position, selection, and
  visibility; a no-op or stale target is refused before mutation.
- Human `TaskDimRepair` and Native now share compiled `DimensionBuilder` repair
  entry points for ordinary, Extent, Chamfer, and Arc Length dimensions;
  Axonometric Length layers its existing shared direction/value analysis over
  the same compiled reference replacement. Broken references remain visible in
  the Drawing snapshot with raw targets, bounded issues, `host_valid`, and
  independently verified `references_valid`; valid dimensions include the same
  exact repair target beside their established state. One snapshot caches each
  projected view's element inventory, so many dimensions on one view do not
  repeatedly rebuild identical geometry state.

  TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; source/release staging
  is byte-identical, every focused module remains below 1,000 lines, and Ruff,
  Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Select Line Attributes is represented by the dedicated read-only
  `drawing.line_defaults` capability with one argument-free `read_current`
  operation. This reflects the shipped command's real semantics: the dialog
  selects application-session defaults rather than document geometry. The
  exact result reports the active line standard and standards body, selected
  line number, host style code and name, exact width and human thin/middle/thick
  choice, all three current width values, RGB color, visibility, cascade
  spacing, delta distance, and the bounded ordered style catalog. The concise
  Drawing snapshot includes the current selection, choices, catalog count,
  validity, issues, and stable state hash while omitting the full catalog.
- Human and Native read the same compiled TechDraw state through
  `TechDrawGui.currentLineDefaults()`. The human dialog remains the sole owner
  of interactive session-default mutation; the Native read path opens no task,
  transaction, or document mutation and does not advance structural revision.
  The lifecycle proves the human dialog can select style, thick width, spacing,
  and delta distance and Native returns the identical state while preserving
  document objects, page ownership, History, selection, visibility, and
  revision across duplicate reads and same-process save/reopen.

  reports success. TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly;
  source/release staging is byte-identical, focused modules remain bounded, and
  Ruff, Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Change Line Attributes is one closed `drawing.line_attributes` capability.
  Its supplemental `read_view` operation returns a bounded, paginated inventory
  of persistent cosmetic edges and centerlines. Its primary `set` operation
  freezes the exact page, view, projected geometry, complete line inventory,
  current line-default catalog, and every target line through stable hashes.
  Each target is a kind-qualified UUID, and each mutation supplies the complete
  resulting line number, pinned thin/middle/thick width choice, RGB color, and
  visibility. The schema publishes its 32-target, 48-item page, and 512-line
  inventory bounds and contains no open object bags or unknown provider types.
- The shipped human command and Native use one compiled `LineAttributeBuilder`
  for target resolution, validation, and mutation. It validates the complete
  batch before touching either persistent property, refreshes only affected
  cosmetic/centerline geometry, and preserves page/view ownership, projected
  geometry, History, selection, visibility, and unrelated line state. The host
  now serializes the inherited UUIDs of `CosmeticEdge` and `CenterLine`; this
  corrects their pre-existing save/reopen identity loss while retaining the
  optional-element fallback for older FCStd documents, which acquire durable
  identities the next time they are saved.

  TechDrawGui, and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; source/release staging
  is byte-identical, every focused file remains below 1,000 lines, and Ruff,
  Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Extend Line and Shorten Line are one closed `drawing.line_length`
  capability with `extend`, `shorten`, and supplemental `read_view`
  operations. Both mutations require one exact kind-qualified persistent-line
  UUID and an explicit positive per-end delta in canonical unscaled view
  millimetres. The target is limited to straight cosmetic edges and
  centerlines, and shortening must leave a positive line length. Every call
  freezes the exact page, view definition, projected geometry, complete line
  inventory, and target line through stable hashes. The schema publishes its
  48-item page and 512-line inventory bounds and contains no open provider
  object bags or unknown types.
- The shipped human commands and Native use one compiled `LineLengthBuilder`
  for exact target resolution, validation, and symmetric endpoint mutation.
  The host refreshes cosmetic edges and centerlines together in canonical
  order, preventing an edit in either persistent list from renumbering the
  other list's projected `EdgeN` identity. Transaction cloning now carries
  cosmetic-edge permanent endpoints and radius, Undo/Redo synchronizes the
  cached projected geometry with restored persistent properties, and
  centerline restore preserves its serialized `Flip` value instead of
  inverting it. Together these host corrections make the same human and Native
  operations durable through exact Undo/Redo and FCStd save/reopen while
  preserving page ownership, History, selection, visibility, formatting, and
  every non-target line.

  line-length, neighboring Drawing, registry, and action-manifest contracts
  pass. TechDraw, TechDrawGui, and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly;
  source/release staging is byte-identical, every focused file remains below
  1,000 lines, and Ruff, Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation
  are clean.
- Lock/Unlock View is one closed `drawing.view_lock` capability with a primary
  `set` operation and supplemental `read_page`. Native does not inherit the
  human command's state-dependent toggle semantics: every 1-through-32-view
  mutation supplies an explicit final `locked` boolean for each exact target,
  so mixed lock and unlock requests remain deterministic and atomic. The page,
  complete lockable-view inventory, and each view are independently
  hash-pinned. The low-cost state includes stable identity, page ownership,
  exact position, lock state, timeline usability, and validity; the schema
  publishes its 512-view inventory, 48-item page, and 32-change limits and
  contains no open provider object bags or unknown types.
- The shipped human command and Native now share compiled `ViewLockBuilder`
  validation and mutation. It validates the complete batch before touching a
  property, rejects duplicate, cross-page, and already-satisfied requests,
  then sets `DrawViewPart::LockPosition` without changing positions, view
  definitions, page membership, History, selection, visibility, or unrelated
  lock state. Drawing context publishes a concise page-level inventory hash
  and exact per-view lock target while the supplemental read returns bounded
  pages only when needed.

  manifest contracts pass. TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build
  cleanly; source/release staging is byte-identical, every focused file remains
  below 1,000 lines, and Ruff, Python compilation, and scoped whitespace
  validation are clean.
- Drawing section-view positioning is implemented as the two closed branches
  `drawing.section_position.align_axis` and `align_edge_to_vertex`, both mapped
  to the shipped `TechDraw_ExtensionPositionSectionView` action. The human
  command and Native share `SectionViewPosition` for standard-section
  validation, projection-group base resolution, orthogonal geometry, and the
  final mutation. The human command retains its nearest-axis behavior while
  Native requires an explicit horizontal or vertical axis; geometry alignment
  requires hash-pinned section projection, straight edge, base projection,
  alignment owner, and vertex targets.
- The exact section-position target hashes durable view definition and page
  placement separately from transient TechDraw projection-cache counters.
  Mutation is immediate, atomic, undoable, and refuses no-ops, stale section or
  projection state, stale elements, cross-page targets, invalid standard
  sections, and verifier failures. Postconditions preserve the section
  definition, projected geometry, base view, page membership, History,
  selection, visibility, and all unrelated objects while returning only the
  old/new placement and chosen alignment targets.

- Area and arc-length annotations are the two closed branches of one
  `drawing.measurement_annotation` family. Each request freezes one exact page,
  projected view, complete projection hash, 1-through-64 ordered unique FaceN
  or EdgeN targets, every element hash, and an explicit label. Value, units,
  Unicode text, anchor, default placement, and style are derived by TechDraw;
  the provider cannot supply or override measured data. The concise result
  returns the durable ordered sources, stored and current source values,
  currentness, placement, style, page/view ownership, History usability,
  validity, and a stable measurement hash without returning the projection
  inventory.
- The shipped human Area Annotation and Arc Length Annotation commands and
  Native use the same compiled `BalloonBuilder` validators and constructor.
  `DrawViewBalloon` now has typed output properties for measurement kind,
  ordered projected source, and internal mm or mm² value; those references
  survive undo/redo and FCStd reopen. Human movement and restyling remain
  valid and visible in Native context: state reports current placement and
  whether the stored value still matches its sources instead of inferring
  identity from text or silently dropping a manually edited annotation.

  source/release staging is byte-identical, every focused file remains below
  1,000 lines, and Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation
  are clean.
- Format customization is one closed `drawing.format` family with explicit
  `set_dimension_format` and `set_balloon_text` branches. Each request names
  one selected page child and its exact format-state hash, then supplies only
  a complete replacement `FormatSpec` or literal Balloon text. The schema has
  no generic property selector, inferred target kind, provider preview,
  optional-field bag, or hidden non-empty requirement; the selected Drawing
  context publishes the current value, actual host preview, page and type,
  validity, History usability, and the exact target hash directly.
- The shipped Customize Format dialog and Native use the same compiled
  `FormatBuilder` validation and mutation. TechDraw owns numeric-placeholder
  validation and the displayed dimension preview; Balloon text remains
  literal, including the human command's valid empty value. The Native path
  is immediate and atomic, refuses stale hashes, no-ops, invalid formats, and
  wrong target types with exact repair data, preserves page membership,
  History, selection, visibility, and unrelated objects, and supports both
  ordinary and typed measurement Balloons without opening a task dialog.

  cleanly, production source/release staging is byte-identical, every focused
  file remains below 1,000 lines, and Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped
  whitespace validation are clean.
- Circle Center Lines is one closed `drawing.circle_center_lines.create`
  operation mapped only to `TechDraw_ExtensionCircleCenterLines`. It consumes
  the existing selected-projection state directly: one exact page, one exact
  view and projection hash, and 1-through-32 ordered unique circular `EdgeN`
  targets with individual element hashes. The provider cannot supply
  positions, radii, extensions, styles, or generic geometry; TechDraw derives
  the complete horizontal and vertical cross for each selected full circle or
  circular arc.
- The shipped human command and Native use the same compiled
  `CircleCenterLineBuilder`. It validates every source before mutation, uses
  the current host line defaults with the configured centerline style, creates
  exactly two persistent cosmetic edges per source, rebuilds the shared
  cosmetic/centerline projection order, and returns the durable tags. Native
  resolves those tags back through the existing exact line-format and
  line-length inventories, preserves prior persistent lines by stable tag,
  and returns concise source, tag, current `EdgeN`, endpoint, length, and hash
  state without copying the full projection inventory.

  source/release staging is byte-identical, every focused file remains below
  1,000 lines, and Python compilation, Ruff, and scoped whitespace validation
  are clean.
- Bolt Circle Centerlines is one closed
  `drawing.bolt_circle_center_lines.create` operation mapped only to
  `TechDraw_ExtensionHoleCircle`. It consumes one exact page, one exact view
  and projection hash, and 3-through-32 ordered unique projected circle or
  circular-arc `EdgeN` targets with individual element hashes. The provider
  cannot supply the pattern center, pattern radius, mark endpoints, extension,
  or line style. The first three ordered hole centers define the pattern
  circle, matching the shipped human command exactly.
- The human command and Native share the compiled
  `CircleCenterLineBuilder` validation and mutation. It validates the complete
  source set before mutation, derives one canonical persistent cosmetic circle,
  adds one radial center mark extending 1.1 hole radii through each source,
  applies the active host line defaults, refreshes shared projected cosmetic
  state, and returns one stable circle tag plus one stable line tag per hole.
  Native resolves the pattern circle and every radial line back to current
  `EdgeN`, geometry, format, and state hashes. Additional holes that do not lie
  on the first-three pattern remain accepted exactly as they are by the human
  command; the concise result explicitly reports the maximum radial deviation,
  tolerance, and `all_centers_on_pattern` instead of concealing the condition
  or introducing a Native-only rejection.

- The four shipped cosmetic-thread actions are one closed
  `drawing.thread_representation` family with the explicit operations
  `create_hole_side`, `create_hole_bottom`, `create_bolt_side`, and
  `create_bolt_bottom`. Each operation maps to exactly its human action and a
  distinct exact-target contract. Side requests contain one hash-pinned page,
  one hash- and projection-pinned view, and exactly two ordered, unique
  projected `EdgeN` boundary targets with individual element hashes. Bottom
  requests contain the same page/view authority and 1-through-32 ordered,
  unique, individually hash-pinned full-circle `EdgeN` targets. The provider
  cannot supply thread factors, derived lines, arc radii or spans, line
  weights, colors, visibility, or persistent tags.
- Human commands and Native share the compiled `ThreadRepresentationBuilder`.
  It validates canonical unscaled projected geometry before mutation, rejects
  zero-length or nonparallel side boundaries and non-circle bottom targets,
  derives the existing 1.176 hole and 0.85 bolt conventions, creates the
  existing two thin solid side boundaries plus the hole-only graphic-weight
  end line, and creates bottom arcs from 15 through 285 degrees. Every result
  uses current host color and visibility, the host Thin/Graphic weights, and a
  durable cosmetic tag. The human side commands retain their existing
  first-two-selected-edge behavior, and the human bottom commands retain their
  existing per-selection acceptance behavior; Native preflights its complete
  exact target set atomically. Native resolves every created tag back to
  current `EdgeN`, exact geometry, format, and state hashes while proving prior
  persistent lines, page membership, History, selection, and visibility did
  not change.

  movement, forced rollback, FCStd save/reopen, and durable tags. All 111
  focused registry, surface, action-manifest, circle/line/thread contracts and
  all 47 Drawing contracts pass. The neighboring line-attribute, line-length,
  circle-centerline, and bolt-circle compiled lifecycles remain green, and the

  TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; production source and
  release staging are byte-identical; every newly added implementation and
  gate file remains below 700 lines; and Python compilation, Ruff lint and
  formatting, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Drawing vertex-at-intersection and offset-vertex now share one exact
  `drawing.cosmetic_vertex` family with the action-specific operations
  `create_intersections` and `create_offset`. Intersection requests contain one
  hash-pinned page, one hash- and projection-pinned view, and exactly two
  distinct, individually hash-pinned projected `EdgeN` targets. Offset requests
  contain the same exact page/view boundary, one individually hash-pinned
  projected `VertexN`, and one closed explicit unscaled X/Y millimetre offset;
  zero offset remains valid. The provider cannot supply derived intersections,
  the final offset point, style, visibility, or persistent tags.
- Both shipped human paths and Native use the compiled
  `CosmeticVertexBuilder`. The intersection command creates every point
  returned by TechDraw's geometry intersection in host order. The offset task
  retains its task-owned live-preview transaction, including replacement of a
  prior preview, accept retention, and reject rollback; its existing two-arg
  external construction path remains available while the shipped command uses
  the exact selected `VertexN` boundary. The builder converts projected points
  to conventional unscaled view coordinates, applies the host persistent
  cosmetic-vertex format, refreshes geometry and paint once, and returns
  durable tags. Native resolves those tags to current `VertexN`, exact point,
  format, per-vertex digest, and inventory digest while proving prior vertices,
  objects, page membership, History, projected sources, selection, and
  visibility did not change.
- Intersection and offset remain covered by the current four-operation
  compiled cosmetic-vertex lifecycle documented with rows 15.75 and 15.76
  below. That expanded gate retains both human oracles, offset-task preview,
  cancellation and acceptance, zero-offset behavior, all host-derived
  intersections, exact refusal, rollback, replay, undo/redo, snapshot, and
  durable save/reopen coverage without carrying a stale two-operation result.
- The four shipped cosmetic-circle and arc actions are one closed
  `drawing.cosmetic_curve` family with the exact operations
  `create_one_point_circle`, `create_two_point_circle`,
  `create_three_point_circle`, and `create_center_start_end_arc`. Every request
  pins one page, one view definition, the complete projection, and each ordered
  projected `VertexN` source independently. The one-point operation accepts
  only an explicit positive unscaled radius; the other operations use named
  center, radius, perimeter, start, and end roles. The provider cannot supply a
  derived center, derived radius, arc angle, direction, line format, current
  `EdgeN`, or durable tag.
- Every shipped human path and Native use the compiled
  `CosmeticCurveBuilder`. It preserves the existing one-point task's circle and
  arc creation branches, including reject-without-mutation, and delegates the
  two-point, three-point, and counter-clockwise arc commands without duplicating
  geometry math. The builder converts projected vertices into conventional
  unscaled Drawing coordinates, derives the unique circle or ordered arc in
  host code, applies the active complete line format, and returns a UUID tag.
  Durable readback resolves the tag to the current `EdgeN` and derives
  canonical arc angles and direction from the actual center/start/mid/end
  geometry rather than TechDraw's unreliable mirrored-arc direction flag.
  Native proves that prior curves, objects, page membership, History, projected
  sources, selection, and visibility remain unchanged, and returns only exact
  sources, the created curve, and the resulting inventory digest.

  refusal without revision or undo movement, forced rollback, one-step
  undo/redo, snapshot targeting, and FCStd save/reopen with stable UUID tags.
  All 57 focused cosmetic-curve, registry, and action-manifest contracts pass.
  The cosmetic-vertex, circle-centerline, bolt-circle-centerline, all four
  thread-representation, line-attribute, and line-length compiled lifecycle
  gates remain green, and the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker
  integration reports success. TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build
  cleanly; production source and release staging are byte-identical; the shared
  builder is 519 lines, the five implementation modules are 394, 49, 70, 179,
  and 458 lines, and the compiled gate is 687 lines. Python compilation, Ruff
  lint and formatting, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- The two shipped parallel/perpendicular cosmetic-line actions are one closed
  `drawing.cosmetic_line` family with separate `create_parallel` and
  `create_perpendicular` branches. Each request pins one page, one part-view
  definition, the complete projection, one exact projected straight `EdgeN`,
  and one exact projected `VertexN` through point with independent element
  hashes. The provider cannot supply endpoints, direction vectors, length,
  coordinate-system conversions, line format, current cosmetic `EdgeN`, or a
  durable tag. The role-specific schemas reject an edge in the vertex role or
  a vertex in the edge role before provider execution, while a schema-valid
  curved edge receives a precise host refusal naming the accepted projected
  straight-edge and vertex roles.
- Both human commands and Native delegate to the compiled
  `CosmeticLineBuilder`; there is no duplicate Python geometry path. The
  builder accepts either human selection order, resolves the exact projected
  straight edge and vertex, converts rotated/scaled projected geometry into
  conventional unscaled Drawing-view millimetres, creates a same-length line
  centered on the selected vertex, derives the parallel or perpendicular
  direction in host code, applies the complete current `LineFormat`, and
  returns a durable UUID. Readback resolves that UUID to the current `EdgeN`,
  canonicalizes the unoriented endpoints, and publishes the complete
  persistent line inventory. Native proves prior lines, source element hashes,
  objects, page membership, History, selection, visibility, page state, and
  view definition remain unchanged and returns only the named sources, exact
  derived line, persistent format/tag, and resulting inventory digest.

  one-step undo/redo, selection-backed snapshot targeting, and FCStd
  save/reopen with stable UUID tags. All 58 focused cosmetic-line, registry,
  and action-manifest contracts pass. The cosmetic-curve, cosmetic-vertex,
  line-attribute, line-length, circle-centerline, bolt-circle-centerline, and
  all four thread-representation compiled lifecycle gates remain green, and
  the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle reports success.
  TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; production source and

  five implementation modules are 371, 49, 59, 137, and 401 lines, and the
  compiled gate is 586 lines. Ruff lint and formatting, Python compilation,
  and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Diameter, square, and repetition prefix insertion, prefix removal, and
  decimal-precision increase/decrease now resolve to the closed
  `drawing.dimension_text` capability. Every branch accepts one exact Drawing
  page plus an ordered, unique batch of 1 to 64 hash-pinned dimensions;
  repetition alone accepts a bounded integer count from 1 through 9999. The
  provider never accepts raw format strings, GUI selection, or ambiguous
  targets. A batch is all-or-nothing: any stale, wrong-page, duplicate,
  malformed, or inapplicable dimension refuses before opening a transaction
  and reports the exact target and reason.
- The actual human commands and Native use the same compiled
  `DimensionTextBuilder`. It preserves the established human transformations,
  arbitrary repetition-dialog text, mixed non-dimension selection behavior,
  no-op behavior, one-document transaction boundary, and multi-page selection
  support. Native adds exact one-page authority, strict integer repetition,
  preflight/application plan equality, and postconditions proving objects,
  page membership, History, selection, visibility, page definition, projected
  geometry, and every non-format dimension property remain unchanged.

  six Native branches to two dimensions atomically, proves exact inapplicable
  repairs and mixed-batch refusal, stale/wrong-type refusal, same-call replay,
  forced rollback, one-step undo/redo, selection-backed snapshot targeting,
  and FCStd save/reopen. All 66 focused dimension-text, registry, and
  action-manifest contracts pass. The general dimension, complete-format, and
  parallel/perpendicular cosmetic-line compiled lifecycles remain green, and
  the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle reports success.
  TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; production source and
  release staging are byte-identical; the shared builder is 184 lines, its
  header is 64 lines, the five implementation modules are 418, 49, 69, 167,
  and 181 lines, and the compiled gate is 633 lines. Ruff lint, Python
  compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Drawing presentation now resolves to the closed `drawing.presentation`
  capability with three explicit operations: `set_frame_visibility`,
  `set_grid_visibility`, and `set_hidden_edges_visible`. Each accepts the exact
  human-active Drawing page or view, its persistent definition hash, the exact
  presentation-state hash, and the desired boolean state; it never exposes a
  toggle, GUI selection, raw scene internals, or an ambiguous target. Results
  report only identity, prior and resulting states, whether anything changed,
  and the new exact presentation hash.
- The toolbar and Drawing-page context commands, passive Python inspection,
  Native preflight, and Native application share the compiled
  `FrameVisibilityBuilder` presentation implementation. Passive frame
  inspection is separate from the
  human-active-page mutation guard, and a compiled availability read prevents
  unavailable Manual-mode state from generating console noise. The existing
  TechDraw SVG-template refresh now avoids redundant `Width`, `Height`, and
  `Orientation` writes, so rebuilding editable markers cannot manufacture
  structural revisions for unchanged template metadata. Frame presentation
  therefore remains outside document transactions, undo, History, and Native
  structural revision without weakening the dispatcher's read-side-effect
  guard. Grid and hidden-edge ViewProvider properties survive FCStd reopen.

  exact live state, frame page-image hashes, same-state idempotency,
  stale/wrong-type/preference refusal, forced rollback, unchanged document and
  human UI boundaries, active-page snapshot state, and transient reset after
  FCStd save/reopen. All 78 focused presentation, registry, action-manifest,
  and complete-registry contracts pass; the neighboring six-operation
  dimension-text lifecycle and protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker
  lifecycle remain green. TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build cleanly;
  production source and release staging are byte-identical; the shared builder
  is 79 lines, its header is 44 lines, the five implementation modules are 273,
  49, 31, 97, and 101 lines, and the compiled gate is 420 lines. Ruff lint,
  Python compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Standard image hatch and geometric PAT hatch now resolve to one closed
  `drawing.hatch` capability with separate default-pattern and human-authorized
  file branches plus one path-free defaults/catalog read. Every mutation pins
  one page, one projected view definition, the complete projection, and 1 to
  64 unique `FaceN` states independently; it accepts the complete explicit
  image or geometric style, an exact PAT catalog name where applicable, and a
  preferred label whose exact FreeCAD-assigned form is reported. Provider
  schemas never expose file paths: configured defaults are claimed and hashed
  by the host, while custom SVG/bitmap/PAT inputs require a one-shot human file
  authorization whose exact request identity is preserved through preflight.
- Both existing human task paths and Native use the compiled `HatchBuilder`.
  It validates the live page/view/faces, file type or bounded PAT catalog,
  complete finite style, and duplicate image-hatch conflicts; creates the
  canonical TechDraw hatch object; embeds the pattern content for portable
  FCStd save/reopen; recomputes only that hatch; and requests the source-view
  repaint. Native does not recursively recompute the unchanged source view or
  page: doing so started TechDraw's asynchronous face extraction and exposed a
  transient face-less projection to the synchronous postcondition. The final
  transaction boundary therefore verifies the already recomputed shared-host
  result without launching unrelated HLR work, while still proving exact
  objects, page membership, source view definition and geometry, History,
  selection, visibility, durable pattern hash, style, validity, rollback, and
  one-step undo/redo.

  geometric operations each change the rendered page, exercises all five
  provider branches, cancellation, stale/wrong-type/duplicate/invalid-pattern
  refusal, injected post-create rollback, exact tree children and History,
  concise snapshot state, one-step undo/redo, and portable save/reopen after
  both custom source files are deleted. All 87 focused hatch, presentation,
  capability-registry, action-manifest, and complete-registry contracts pass;
  the neighboring frame-presentation and six-operation dimension-text compiled
  lifecycles remain green, and the protected TechDraw VibeScript API/worker
  integration reports success. TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build
  cleanly; production source and release staging are byte-identical; the
  provider schema is 10,412 bytes; the shared builder is 361 lines, its header
  is 113 lines, the five hatch implementation modules are 753, 42, 93, 252,
  and 394 lines, the shared label contract is 15 lines, the compiled gate is
  579 lines, and the focused contract is 147 lines. Ruff lint, Python
  compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean.
- Rich annotation now resolves to one closed `drawing.rich_annotation`
  capability with three deliberately separate operations: escaped plain-text
  creation, bounded resource-free rich-HTML creation, and a transaction-free
  defaults read. Both mutations freeze one exact page hash and either the page
  owner or one exact view-owner hash; require explicit page placement,
  automatic-or-fixed wrapping, a preferred label, and the complete frame
  visibility/width/style/RGB state; and return only bounded plain-text preview,
  counts, hashes, exact persisted state, and the next useful inspection action.
  Provider content is capped at 4,096 characters and never returns the stored
  HTML blob.
- The shipped human task and Native preflight/application share the compiled
  `RichAnnotationBuilder`. It validates live page/owner identity, finite style,
  UTF-8, canonical Qt rich text, visible content, blocks, fragments, links, and
  labels; rejects images, external resources, active elements, event handlers,
  media, forms, SVG, stylesheets, CSS URLs, and unsafe link schemes; creates the
  canonical `TechDraw::DrawRichAnno`; assigns the exact page/view ownership;
  enrolls the fully configured object in History before repaint; recomputes the
  feature; and requests its immediate page repaint inside the caller-owned
  transaction. Malformed compiled-host maps and nested values produce one
  stable runtime-unavailable failure instead of Python lookup or coercion
  exceptions. Human-editor HTML remains on its broader existing policy.
- The lifecycle work exposed and corrected two real TechDraw scene defects.
  `QGSPage::addRichAnno` no longer reparents the same annotation twice through
  incompatible coordinate conversions. `QGIView` now maps page-positioned,
  owner-linked items back into the graphical owner's local coordinates, while
  preserving the intentional owner-local semantics of Dimensions and Balloons.
  The tree consequently has one coherent hierarchy: page-owned annotations are
  direct page children, while view-owned annotations are children of the exact
  view, without duplicate tree entries. The actual human command and Native
  plain/rich operations all change the rendered page immediately.

  one-step undo/redo, save/reopen, tree and History placement, snapshot state,
  preserved human selection/visibility, and no Native task dialog. All 96
  focused rich-annotation, hatch, presentation, registry, action-manifest, and
  capability-registry contracts pass. Neighboring hatch, presentation,
  Balloon, and general Dimension compiled lifecycles remain green, including
  their coordinate, tree, undo, and reopen gates, and the protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker integration reports success. TechDrawGui and staged
  SteveCAD scripts build cleanly; seven declared production/source files are
  byte-identical to release staging; Ruff, Python compilation, and scoped
  whitespace validation are clean. The shared builder and header are 515 and
  107 lines; the five focused Native modules are 796, 49, 60, 235, and 258
  lines; the compiled gate is 589 lines; and the focused contract is 206 lines.
- Leader Line now resolves through the closed `drawing.annotation` capability
  with only `leader_line` and `read_leader_defaults` branches. Creation freezes
  one exact page hash and one exact page-member owner hash, accepts 2 through
  64 finite page-coordinate points, an explicit preferred label, begin/end
  symbols, continuous/polyline behavior, auto-horizontal completion, and the
  complete visible line format. It returns the exact durable leader state and
  mutation receipt without echoing page inventories or graphical payloads.
  The bounded Drawing snapshot exposes exact selected leader owners, including
  owners nested in a projection group, so the assistant never has to infer the
  owner's placement, scale, rotation, or projection state from prior calls.
- The human task and Native mutation share the compiled `LeaderLineBuilder`.
  It validates the live page and owner relationship, including a view nested
  under one projection group; converts page points through the owner's real
  placement, rotation, and scale; creates the canonical
  `TechDraw::DrawLeaderLine`; applies the complete symbol, behavior, and line
  state; enrolls the configured object in History; recomputes it; and requests
  repaint inside the caller-owned transaction. The graphical-item coordinate
  policy now treats Leaders, Dimensions, and Balloons as owner-local while
  retaining page coordinates for page-owned annotations, which removes the
  prior tree/render mismatch without a file-specific exception.
- Drawing remains inside the unchanged 32-tool provider limit for all four
  dimension-preference variants. Leader uses the planned annotation family,
  while all 16 general, chamfer, arc-length, area-annotation, and
  arc-annotation mutations use one strongly discriminated `drawing.dimension`
  family. The obsolete standalone special-dimension and
  measurement-annotation registrations and runtimes are removed; action
  planning now uses unambiguous `create_arc_length_dimension`,
  `create_area_annotation`, and `create_arc_length_annotation` branches. Read
  and mutation classifications remain separate. Every 86-, 107-, 111-, and
  112-action Drawing graph resolves to exactly 32 families with one Dimension
  and one Annotation tool.
- The consolidation gate also exposed and corrected arc-length dimensions that
  stored a literal display string as an arbitrary value. The shared host model
  now returns the persisted `ArcLengthValue` as the dimension's real measured
  value and uses a valid numeric format specification prefixed by the arc
  symbol. Human creation, Native creation, repair, rendering, state hashing,
  undo/redo, and save/reopen consequently share one unit-aware representation
  without formatter warnings.

  existing `drawing.cosmetic_vertex` capability, alongside intersection and
  offset creation; it does not add another provider tool. The branch freezes
  one exact page, Drawing view, view-definition hash, and projection hash, then
  accepts one finite point in explicit `drawing_view_unscaled_mm`,
  `x_right_y_up` coordinates. Its concise result resolves the created durable
  tag to the exact current `VertexN`, canonical point, complete host-default
  format, vertex-state hash, and resulting bounded inventory hash.
- The human `TechDraw_CosmeticVertex` task and Native preflight/application now
  share `CosmeticVertexBuilder`. The compiled builder validates the live page
  and view, coordinate bounds, and canonical two-dimensional point; creates
  the persistent cosmetic vertex; applies the same complete default format as
  the intersection and offset branches; refreshes projected vertex geometry;
  requests repaint; and proves that the durable tag survived. The human task
  retains its existing tracker and explicit X/Y UI, accept/reject behavior,
  and owned transaction while no longer calling `addCosmeticVertex` directly.
- The compiled lifecycle reports
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_COSMETIC_VERTEX_GUI_OK operations=4
  intersection=true offset=true point=true canonical_coordinates=true
  midpoints=true ordered_sources=true
  human_oracle=true shared_host_builder=true task_accept=true

  history=true no_intersection=true wrong_type=true stale=true rollback=true
  revision=true idempotency=true undo=true redo=true snapshot=true reopen=true
  low_noise=true native_no_task=true`. It exercises the real human task and
  Native dispatcher on a rotated, scaled Drawing view, proves identical
  canonical point creation, rejects an out-of-range point before mutation,
  and covers cancellation, exact hashes, rollback, one-step undo/redo,
  save/reopen, low-noise results, and unchanged selection, visibility, object,
  page-membership, and History boundaries. All 226 focused Drawing, manifest,
  registry, surface-authority, surface-variant, and guardrail contracts pass;
  TechDrawGui and staged SteveCAD scripts build successfully; Ruff, Python
  compilation, and scoped whitespace validation are clean; and the protected
  TechDraw VibeScript API/worker lifecycle remains green.
- Midpoint Vertices is the fourth branch of that same
  `drawing.cosmetic_vertex` family, not another provider tool. It accepts 1 to
  64 unique exact projected `EdgeN` targets with independent element-state
  hashes. The compiled host resolves each live edge, obtains its projected
  midpoint, removes the view's scale and rotation with TechDraw's canonical
  transform, and preserves the provider's source order through preflight,
  creation, concise source-to-vertex results, persistent inventory, undo/redo,
  and save/reopen. No provider-supplied midpoint coordinate is accepted.
- The shipped `TechDraw_Midpoints` command now preflights and creates through
  `CosmeticVertexBuilder`; its former inline geometry lookup, coordinate math,
  and direct `addCosmeticVertex` loop are gone. Human and Native creation on a
  rotated, scaled view produce identical ordered midpoint signatures. Duplicate
  source edges fail before mutation, all selected midpoints share one atomic
  transaction, one undo removes the complete batch, and the existing object,
  page-membership, History, selection, visibility, stale-target, rollback,
  idempotency, low-noise, and VibeScript protections remain green.
- Quadrant Vertices is the fifth branch of `drawing.cosmetic_vertex`. It maps
  only `TechDraw_Quadrants`, accepts 1 to 64 unique hash-pinned projected
  `EdgeN` sources, and asks the compiled TechDraw host to derive exactly three
  ordered quarter-parameter points per source. The provider cannot supply or
  alter point coordinates. The shipped human command and Native path share
  `CosmeticVertexBuilder`, persistent vertex tags, source associations, and
  one transaction for the complete batch. A rotated/scaled full-circle gate
  proves identical human and Native results, duplicate/stale refusal,
  postcondition rollback, one-step undo/redo, save/reopen, unchanged selection,
  page membership, visibility, objects, and History.
- Face, two-line, and two-point centerlines are three explicit variants of the
  focused `drawing.centerline` family, mapped respectively to
  `TechDraw_FaceCenterLine`, `TechDraw_2LineCenterLine`, and
  `TechDraw_2PointCenterLine`. Their schemas accept only exact hash-pinned
  projected faces, edge pairs, or vertex pairs. The focused compiled
  `GeneralCenterLineBuilder` owns selection-kind validation, host defaults,
  orientation repair, unscaled Drawing-view endpoint derivation, line format,
  durable centerline identity, and inventory readback. `TaskCenterLine` uses
  the same builder for human acceptance; Native opens no task dialog. One real
  dispatcher lifecycle creates all three forms and proves concise results,
  source hashes, persistent tags, duplicate refusal, rollback, revision
  chaining, independent undo/redo, and exact save/reopen reconstruction.
- Two-point Cosmetic Line is the third `drawing.cosmetic_line` variant and maps
  only `TechDraw_2PointCosmeticLine`. It accepts exactly two distinct
  hash-pinned projected vertices in endpoint order. TechDraw derives both
  canonical endpoints and the current line format; the provider supplies no
  coordinates or style. `TaskCosmeticLine` and Native persist through the same
  `CosmeticLineBuilder` segment primitive. The combined real-GUI gate proves
  the existing parallel/perpendicular paths plus two-point creation, exact
  sources, human/host parity, durable tags, low-noise results, rollback,
  one-step undo/redo, and save/reopen.
- The complete five-row Drawing block builds and links `TechDrawGui` and staged
  SteveCAD scripts, passes 66 focused schema/manifest/registry contracts, and
  passes all three compiled GUI lifecycle gates. The protected TechDraw
  VibeScript API/worker lifecycle also passes unchanged.
- ISO 286 fit, ISO/ASME surface-finish symbols, and weld symbols now use exact
  shared host boundaries instead of Native-only document synthesis. The
  shipped Hole/Shaft Fit task calls the packaged `FitBuilder`; the human and
  Native surface-finish paths share `SurfaceFinishSymbolBuilder`; and human
  weld creation/editing plus Native preflight/application share
  `WeldSymbolBuilder`, including a bounded 26-item catalog, embedded SVG
  resources, exactly two owned History tiles, exact page/leader ownership, and
  caller-owned transactions. `drawing.symbol` publishes five closed branches
  for ISO and ASME surface finish, weld create/edit, and a non-mutating catalog
  read; ISO 286 is a focused `drawing.format` branch. State hashing now
  canonicalizes signed zero and durable eight-bit leader colors, so semantic
  identity survives undo and FCStd persistence without false stale refusals.
  The focused compiled lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_ENGINEERING_SYMBOLS_GUI_OK operations=6
  iso286_fit=true surface_finish=true weld_create=true weld_edit=true
  weld_catalog=true human_oracles=3 shared_builders=true embedded_svg=true
  exact_targets=true stale_refusal=true history_resources=true visual=true
  undo=true redo=true snapshot=true reopen=true low_noise=true`. The live gate
  also exposed and corrected the missing FitBuilder runtime packaging entry,
  a null weld-root dereference in human creation, and Python-side reliance on
  an unexposed `getTiles()` method. TechDrawGui builds and links successfully,
  staged scripts are current, and the complete human/Native lifecycle is green.
- Drawing output is one closed, branch-preserving `drawing.export` family:
  SVG, DXF, and PDF each accept one hash-pinned current-History page, ask the
  human for a destination without exposing its path to the provider, render
  through the shipped `PagePrinter` boundary in a managed job, validate the
  bounded artifact, and atomically publish it. Print All accepts no noisy
  provider parameters because its exact meaning is every current-History page;
  it runs the real platform print dialog, revalidates the frozen page set
  immediately before submission, and reports only authorization, submission,
  output mode, and page count—never a printer identity or path. Existing human
  APIs and commands remain intact; an additive TechDrawGui result boundary lets
  Native distinguish cancellation from submission. File and input authorization
  dialogs are now explicitly dispatched to Qt's document thread, closing the
  off-thread GUI failure path. The focused compiled lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_OUTPUT_GUI_OK operations=4 svg=true dxf=true pdf=true
  print_all_dialog=true cancellation=true background=true
  atomic_publication=true bounded_validation=true paths_hidden=true
  exact_target=true stale_refusal=true revision_stable=true undo_stable=true
  low_noise=true`; it proves three real artifacts, the real Print All dialog and
  cancellation path, exact stale refusal before authorization, stable undo and
  structural revision, closed schemas, and path-free results.
- Drawing targeting and direct editing now close the remaining semantic/UI
  boundary. Projected `EdgeN`, `VertexN`, and `FaceN` names are never accepted
  alone: every source is resolved against the exact view-definition hash, the
  complete projected-geometry hash, and its own semantic element hash. The
  concise page snapshot now reports view placement, dimensions, bounded
  unresolved-reference diagnostics, Keep Updated/current status, and explicit
  export readiness; selected dimensions include one complete edit-state hash.
  `drawing.dimension.edit` atomically replaces the exact display, tolerance,
  label/angle layout, and appearance state without opening the human task
  dialog, while the Edit Dimension and Edit Balloon context entries remain
  human-only. `drawing.presentation.show` uses the same ViewProvider page path
  as Show Drawing to open and activate an exact current-History page without a
  document transaction, undo entry, or structural revision. The compiled gates
  emit `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_DIMENSION_GUI_OK ... exact_edit=true
  complete_edit_state=true human_edit_remains_human=true ... undo=true
  redo=true snapshot=true reopen=true low_noise=true no_task=true` and
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_PRESENTATION_GUI_OK operations=4 show=true ...
  stale=true no_undo=true no_transaction=true no_revision=true snapshot=true
  reopen=true low_noise=true native_no_task=true`. TechDrawGui and staged
  SteveCAD scripts build cleanly.
- Drawing dimension inference and grouped series now complete the authoring
  workflow. General Dimension creates only a uniquely implied semantic result
  and otherwise returns the exact explicit-operation candidates; it never
  guesses radius versus diameter, directional versus aligned distance,
  three-point ordering, or chain versus coordinate intent. The six chain and
  coordinate commands share one compiled validator/creator with their human
  ribbon actions, accept 3 to 64 exact hash-pinned projected vertices, and
  publish each result as one contiguous History block with resource-owned
  dimensions. Oblique carrier geometry is bounded and an aborted call removes
  only its exact carrier tags through a cache-refreshing host boundary. The
  underlying face finder now excludes cosmetic presentation edges, preventing
  dimension carriers from splitting physical projected faces during recompute.
  The compiled lifecycle emits
  `STEVECAD_NATIVE_DRAWING_DIMENSION_SERIES_GUI_OK operations=...6
  human_oracle=true shared_builder=true exact_targets=true history_group=true
  owned_dimensions=true carrier_geometry=true inference=true
  ambiguity_refusal=true candidate_guidance=true selection=true visibility=true
  rollback=true undo=true redo=true reopen=true low_noise=true no_task=true`;

### 19. Roll out without presenting a partial system as complete

- [x] 19.1 Land the manifest and removal inventory first with Native still
  disabled.
- [x] 19.2 Land the new registry, state, result, transaction, and background
  foundations with Native still disabled.
- [x] 19.3 Complete and verify Model.
- [x] 19.4 Complete and verify Sketch.
- [x] 19.5 Complete and verify Assemble.
- [x] 19.6 Complete and verify Mesh.
- [x] 19.7 Complete and verify Analyze.
- [x] 19.8 Complete and verify Manufacture.
- [x] 19.9 Complete and verify Drawing.
- [x] 19.10 Complete and verify Parameters.
- [x] 19.11 Run the full inventory, provider, lifecycle, and release-build gates.
- [x] 19.12 Gate Native live acceptance behind the complete fail-closed
  production-surface resolver. A temporary preference was deliberately not
  introduced because the resolver already withholds Native whenever any
  active-ribbon definition, implementation, target contract, or schema budget
  is incomplete.
- [x] 19.13 Exercise human-driven ribbon changes and real assistant use in every
  resolved surface. One live Codex conversation passed all nine states through
  the production adapter and document-thread tool runner without mutation.
- [x] 19.14 Confirm no temporary developer gate remains after all acceptance
  blockers are empty. The normal human selector remains guarded by document,
  control-mode, transaction, task/edit, recompute, editor-work, authority, and
  complete-surface policy.
- [x] 19.15 Update user documentation with the Native/VibeScript authority
  boundary and human-controlled ribbon behavior.
- [x] 19.16 Update MCP documentation to state that external AI clients cannot
  switch workbenches through the authoring surface.
- [x] 19.17 Publish the complete breaking-change list and replacement workflow.

## Objective `DONE` gate

The effort is complete only when:

- every checkbox above is complete or an owner-approved manifest row explicitly
  classifies the capability as human-only;
- the live manifest contains every current ribbon and contextual action exactly
  once per surface;
- no old workbench pack, compatibility alias, direct native provider name, or
  provider-accessible workbench switch remains;
- no Native tool can activate a ribbon/workbench or enter Sketch edit mode; the
  sole Leave Sketch control exact-targets the current task and invalidates the
  turn;
- every surface stays within its tool-count and schema-byte budgets;
- every normal success and failure satisfies the concise result contract;
- a provider can continue from live state without its historical tool-call
  transcript;
- all mutation tools are exact-target, idempotent, atomic, undoable, and
  reconstructable after save/reopen;
- long operations preserve GUI responsiveness and support cancellation;
- all eight clean-profile workflows and the release build pass;
- VibeScript behavior and VibeScript tests remain intact;
- the mode selector is user-visible only after the complete gate passes.

Status must be reported from this ledger and the live manifest, never from an
estimated completion percentage.
