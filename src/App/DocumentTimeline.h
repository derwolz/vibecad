 *
 * stateSourceIndices is parallel to the flattened orderedNewBlocks. Each
 * non-negative entry identifies one member of the flattened staged old
 * segment whose accepted visibility/suppression state is copied to that new
 * member; -1 retains the newly accepted member state. State indices may

 *
 * consumerReplacementIndices is parallel to the flattened staged old
 * segment. Each entry identifies the one flattened new member to which every
 * retained direct consumer of that old identity has already been relinked.
 * -1 is valid only when staging proved that the old identity had no retained
 * direct consumers.
 *
 * activeRootCount is -1 when the staged segment was wholly active or wholly
 * future; the core derives the invariant result. When the old marker lay
 * between roots inside the segment, activeRootCount explicitly declares how
